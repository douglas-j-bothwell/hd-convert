    perspective, there is a Harness delegate at the center of the whole CI pipeline.
    The build farm has access to VCS (git), artifact repository to get dependencies
    for building the artifacts. The delegate receives the job details from Harness
    which could be on-prem or SaaS-based. The delegate allocates resources on customer
    provided build farm and runs build jobs. The delegate &amp; build farm will be
    sending periodic status, logs and metrics to Harness which will be used for DAG
    orchestration, debugging, health-check, analytics, notifications, and ML model
    generation. The build farm finally stores the built docker images, release artifacts
    to customer desired registry and/or storage. </p><p></p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/i5nl071jo5/articles/3jwkrzywpa/1609202556437/image.png"/></figure><p></p><h3>[What
