<p>Some use cases might benefit from building two separate artifacts from two separate codebases from the same Pipeline. For example, suppose you are developing a feature that requires changes in both a front-end service and a back-end service. You want to create new, up-to-date Docker images whenever a developer makes a new commit in either codebase. Here&#39;s one way you can implement this:</p><ol><li>Create a branch with the same name, such as <code>my_new_feature_ENG-1234</code>, in both code repos.</li><li>Create a CI Pipeline with one of the repos as the Codebase for the Pipeline. The Pipeline has two Stages:<ol><li>One Stage builds an image from the Codebase using a Build and Push an Image to Docker Registry Step.</li><li>The other Stage uses Docker-in-Docker in a Run Step to clone the other codebase and then build and push another image to the Docker Registry.</li></ol></li><li>Define two Webhook triggers for the Pipeline, one for each code repo:<ol><li><strong>Condition:</strong> Branch = my_new_feature_ENG-1234</li><li><strong>Input Set:</strong> Branch = my_new_feature_ENG-1234</li></ol></li><li></li></ol><p></p>
