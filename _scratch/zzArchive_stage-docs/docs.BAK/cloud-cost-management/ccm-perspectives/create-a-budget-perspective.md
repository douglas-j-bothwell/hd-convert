Harness CCM Budgets allow you to set custom budgets and receive alerts when your costs exceed (or are forecasted to exceed) your budget. Budgets are created on Perspectives. If you do not have a Perspective of the resources you would like to budget, [create a new Perspective](create-cost-perspectives.md) and then proceed to set a budget.

This topic describes how to create a new budget.
