Harness subscriptions allow you to tailor the level of cover you need
from each Harness module you use. For Feature Flags, you can subscribe
and upgrade online directly through the Harness Platform instead of
contacting our Sales team, meaning you can manage your subscription
quickly, securely, and at any time. 

Using online subscriptions, you can choose whether to be billed yearly
or monthly, and can select the exact number of licenses you need for
your developers and for monthly active users (MAUs). It's as easy as
signing in to the Harness Platform, choosing your [subscription
plan](available-plans-for-feature-flags.md){target="_blank"},
and entering your billing details.  

::: note-callout
Currently online subscriptions are available only to self-serve Feature
Flags customers. For enterprise buyers or for subscribing to other
modules, contact our Sales team
