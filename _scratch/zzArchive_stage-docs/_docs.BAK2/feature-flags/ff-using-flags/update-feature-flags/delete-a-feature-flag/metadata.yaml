    <p>When you are finished with a Feature Flag, it&#39;s best practice to remove it to keep your Flags and application organised and tidy. This topic describes how to delete a Feature Flag on the Harness Platform and using <a href="/article/6f5eylg819-manage-featureflags-in-git-repos" target="_blank">Git</a>.</p>

    <p>If you <a href="/article/6f5eylg819-manage-featureflags-in-git-repos" target="_blank">have set up Git Experience to manage your Flags</a> via a <code>.yaml</code> file on Git, you can delete Flags from there. To do this:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Go to the <code>.yaml</code> file where you manage your Feature Flags.</li>
      <li>Find the Flag you want to delete.</li>
      <li>Delete the <code>- flag</code> object. For example, the following highlighted section would be deleted for the Flag called <code>New_Flag:</code></li>
    </ol>
