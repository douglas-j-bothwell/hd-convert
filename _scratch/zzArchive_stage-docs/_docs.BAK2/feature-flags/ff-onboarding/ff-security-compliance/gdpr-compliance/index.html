<p>Harness Feature Flags are General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliant. To ensure this:</p><ul><li>Harness doesn&#39;t provide a European data residency option, but it does provide teams easy abstractions to remain GDPR compliant in any use case.</li><li>Harness SDKs do not communicate any user data to Harness that you do not choose to send as an attribute. By default, Harness does not need or send any PII.</li><li>If you need to use identifiable customer data for Flag Targeting, you can mask the data or pass it through a custom abstraction layer.</li><li>The data Harness has is then anonymized and not traceable back to end-users directly. Additionally, all data is encrypted in transit.</li><li>For the US, only the IP and email addresses of your team members are stored by Harness.</li><li>Harness provides a data protection agreement to cover this data if necessary.</li></ul><p></p>
