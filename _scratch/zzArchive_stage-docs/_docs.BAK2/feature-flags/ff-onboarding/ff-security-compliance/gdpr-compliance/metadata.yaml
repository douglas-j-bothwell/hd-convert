  body: <p>Harness Feature Flags are General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliant.
    To ensure this:</p><ul><li>Harness doesn&#39;t provide a European data residency
    option, but it does provide teams easy abstractions to remain GDPR compliant in
    any use case.</li><li>Harness SDKs do not communicate any user data to Harness
    that you do not choose to send as an attribute. By default, Harness does not need
    or send any PII.</li><li>If you need to use identifiable customer data for Flag
    Targeting, you can mask the data or pass it through a custom abstraction layer.</li><li>The
    data Harness has is then anonymized and not traceable back to end-users directly.
    Additionally, all data is encrypted in transit.</li><li>For the US, only the IP
    and email addresses of your team members are stored by Harness.</li><li>Harness
    provides a data protection agreement to cover this data if necessary.</li></ul><p></p>
