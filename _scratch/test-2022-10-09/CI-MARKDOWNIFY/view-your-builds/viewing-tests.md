When you run tests in your Pipeline using the **Run** and **Run Tests** Steps, the **Tests** dashboard provides detailed test reporting. 

To publish test results, a Run or Run Tests step must have its **Report Paths** variable set. Test results are in JUnit format. To view the dashboard, once a CI Pipeline is executed, click **Tests**. 

**Tests** show the overall summary of your test.
