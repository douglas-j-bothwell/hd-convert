### Basic steps for creating a Feature Flag

To create a Flag, you need to complete the following steps:

1.  [Create a
    Project](/article/47fkt1ric5-create-a-project){target="_blank"} to
    host your Flags in.
2.  [Create an
    Environment](/article/nh1n5qtjmm-create-an-environment){target="_blank"}
    within your Project. You can have multiple Environments in a single
    Project.
3.  [Create an SDK
    Key](/article/8ja1j98xgp-create-an-sdk-key){target="_blank"} for
    your Environment. You use this to connect to a Feature Flag SDK.
4.  [Create a Feature
    Flag](/article/1j7pdkqh7j-create-a-feature-flag){target="_blank"}.
5.  [Connect your application using one of our
    SDKs](/category/rtce97j1wu-ff-sdks){target="_blank"}.

You can also follow the Get Started tutorial for Feature Flags on the
Harness Platform.
