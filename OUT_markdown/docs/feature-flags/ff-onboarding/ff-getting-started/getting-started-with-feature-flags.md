Watch Feature Flag overview video### Basic steps for creating a Feature Flag

To create a Flag, you need to complete the following steps:

1. [Create a Project](/article/47fkt1ric5-create-a-project) to host your Flags in.
2. [Create an Environment](/article/nh1n5qtjmm-create-an-environment) within your Project. You can have multiple Environments in a single Project.
3. [Create an SDK Key](/article/8ja1j98xgp-create-an-sdk-key) for your Environment. You use this to connect to a Feature Flag SDK.
4. [Create a Feature Flag](/article/1j7pdkqh7j-create-a-feature-flag).
5. [Connect your application using one of our SDKs](/category/rtce97j1wu-ff-sdks).

You can also follow the Get Started tutorial for Feature Flags on the Harness Platform.
