# The issue

I'm trying to create a regex that captures image URLs in the Harness docs in a "non-greedy" manner, up to the FIRST closing paren. The regex I've tried and tried to come up with a regex that works but haven't had any luck. The regex I'm using captures image URLs that include .jpg or png extension AND have a space or newline after the closing paren. These capture ~90% of the URLs, the ones that are correctly formatted. But there are still a lot of URLs that it's missing, and I believe it's all due to the regex used in the accompanying Python file:

_imgURLpattern = re.compile('https?:\/\/files.helpdocs.io\/.*\.(?:png|jpg)')

# Steps to Reproduce

1. Go to the parent folder: `cd $GIT_REPO_HOME/hd-convert/_test-files/images-regex-test`
2. Run the script and pipe to a log: `python3 get-images.TEST.py > test.log`
3. The log shows errors for the images that it can't download. If an image is downloaded successfully, it goes into `docs/static`.

(You'll need to view this README in a raw text editor to see what I'm talking about, GitHub is rendering the images but they're pointing to files on https://files.helpdocs.io, not local copies, which is what I'm looking to do...) 

# TEST 1 -- No space or newline after image link

** Intended behavior:** Regex captures each individual link up to closing paren (2 matches) and downloads/saves the image
** current behavior:**  Regex captures in a greedy mannager, up to the closing paren in the paragraph (one match) and cannot download/save the image

 
1. In Harness, click **Deployments**.
2. Select your Project and click on **Pipelines** and click on **Input Sets**.
3. Click **New Input Set** and select **Import From Git**.![](https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/articles/j7kdfi3640/1658829738986/screenshot-2022-07-26-at-3-30-31-pm.png)The **Import Input Set From Git** settings appear.![](https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/articles/j7kdfi3640/1658830029315/screenshot-2022-07-26-at-11-18-41-am.png)

# TEST 2 -- Image Link does not have Filename Extension

** Intended behavior:** Regex captures the image up to the closing paren. 
** current behavior:**  Regex misses this reference b/c it doesn't include an extension (.jpg or .png)
 
Enter the branch or tag and click **Run Pipeline**.

You can see the logs for the Build and Push step in the Pipeline as it runs.

# TEST 3 -- Successful downloads


## Intended behavior

If the image link is followed by a space or newline, the regex works as intended

## Note

When you run the script and a file downloads successfully, it will update the following links. To revert to the originals, copy/paste this section from backup.txt file. 


Here's a quick visual summary:

 * Click **New Connector** and set up the new Connector as follows:
 	+ **Name:** ci-delegate
 	+ **Details:** Select **Use the credentials of a specific Harness Delegate**. You'll add this Delegate next.
 	+ **Delegates Setup:** Select the Kubernetes Delegate you added earlier using its Tags.
 	+ **Connection Test:** Wait for the test to finish and then click **Finish**. The new Connector is added to the Kubernetes Cluster field.
 * In **Namespace**, enter the namespace `harness-delegate-ng`. Click **Next** to proceed to the Execution tab.
