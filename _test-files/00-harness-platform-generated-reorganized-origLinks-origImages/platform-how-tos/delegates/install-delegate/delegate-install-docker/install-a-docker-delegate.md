The Harness Delegate is a worker process you run in your deployment target environment, such as your local network, VPC, or cluster. The Delegate connects all of your artifact, infrastructure, collaboration, verification and other providers with the Harness Manager.

Most importantly, the Delegate performs all deployment operations.

There are several types of Delegates. This topic describes how to install the Docker Delegate.

### Before You Begin

* [Delegate Installation Overview](/article/re8kk0ex4k-delegate-installation-overview)
* [Projects and Organizations](/article/7fibxie636-projects-and-organizations)

### Review: System Requirements

The Docker Delegate has the following system requirements:

* Default 0.5 CPU.
* Default 768MB RAM: there is a cap of 768MB per Delegate, but when the Delegate is updating there might be two Delegates running. Hence, the minimum is 1.5GB. Ensure that you provide the minimum memory for the Delegate and enough memory for the host/node system.

### Step 1: Download the Docker Delegate

The Delegate can be installed at the Harness account, Organization, or Project level.

You can install a Delegate as part of setting up a Connector or independent of another process.

Once you have selected **New Delegate** on a Delegates page or as part of setting up a Connector, the Delegates selection page appears.

### Step 2: Name and Tag the Delegate

Enter a name for the Delegate. This is the name you will see when the Delegate is listed in Harness.

**Do not run Delegates with the same name in different clusters.** See [Troubleshooting](/article/jzklic4y2j-troubleshooting).Add Tags to the Delegate. By default, Harness adds a Tag using the name you enter, but you can more. Simply type them in and press Enter.

These Tags are useful for selecting the Delegate when creating a Connector.

### Step 3: Run the Docker Delegate Script

If you system already has a Delegate image, then Harness doesn't pull the latest image when you run `docker-compose`. Simply run `docker pull harness/delegate` to pull the latest.Now you can see the YAML file for the Delegate:

![](https://files.helpdocs.io/i5nl071jo5/articles/cya29w2b99/1638578232318/clean-shot-2021-12-03-at-16-37-03.png)Click **Download YAML file** and copy the Docker compose file to a machine where you have Docker installed.

Run the following command to install the Delegate in Docker:


```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml up -d
```
The Delegate installs. Type docker ps to see the container:


```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                     COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                          PORTS                    NAMES  
6b242707a57a        harness/delegate:latest   "/bin/sh -c './entry…"   3 days ago          Up 32 seconds                                            local-docker_harness-ng-del
```
#### Verification

For an overview of verification, see [Delegate Registration and Verification](https://ngdocs.harness.io/article/39tx85rekj-delegate-registration).

In the Delegate wizard, click **Verify** and Harness will verify that it is receiving heartbeats from the Delegate.

Your Delegate is installed.

You can see the registered Delegate in the Delegate list.

That's it. The Delegate is installed and registered and connected.
