Harness Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) lets you grant access to your Resources based on attributes associated with the your Harness Resources.

This topic shows you how to configure ABAC in Harness.

### Attribute-Based Access Control Overview

Harness [Role-Based Access Control](/article/vz5cq0nfg2-rbac-in-harness) (RBAC) helps you manage who has access to your Harness resources, what they can do with those resources, and in what scope they have access.

RBAC is role-based. This means permissions to resources are determined by the roles assigned to Users, User Groups, and Service Accounts.

Harness ABAC builds on top of Harness RBAC by adding [role assignment](/article/vz5cq0nfg2-rbac-in-harness#role_assignment) conditions based on attributes in the context of specific actions. It lets you provide more fine-grained access management or simplify the management of hundreds of role assignments.​ 

With Harness ABAC, you can have an additional check based on the type of your Harness Resources and then do the Role Assignments. The Resource type filters down the Resource Groups for access control.

For example, you can create a Resource Group with all the Production Environments and grant access to this Resource Group through Role Assignment.

### Why and when should I use Harness ABAC?

Harness ABAC helps you achieve the following:

* Provide more fine-grained access control.
* Help reduce the number of Role Assignments.
* Use attributes that have specific business meaning.

Following are a few examples of scenarios to configure ABAC:

* Create/Edit, Delete and Access permissions only for Non-Production Environments.
* Create/Edit, Delete and Access permissions only for Secret Managers.
* View permission for Code Repositories.

### Where can I configure ABAC?

You can add attributes to configure ABAC for the following Harness resources:

* Connectors: Type of Connectors
* Environments: Type of Environments

The following table shows the attributes you can select for Harness ABAC:



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Resource** | **Attributes** |
| **Connectors** | * Cloud Providers
* Secret Managers
* Cloud Costs
* Artifact Repositories
* Code Repositories
* Monitoring and Logging Systems
* Ticketing Systems
 |
| **Environments** | * Production
* Non-Production
 |

### Step 1: Add a new Resource Group

You can configure ABAC in the Account, Org, or Project scope.​

4. Enter a **Name** for your Role and click **Save**.
5. Select all permissions for Environments and Connectors.![](https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/articles/uzzjd4fy67/1661173860962/screenshot-2022-08-22-at-6-39-56-pm.png)
6. Click **Apply Changes**.

### Step 4: Assign Role and Resource Group

Let us now complete the [Role Assignment](/article/vz5cq0nfg2-rbac-in-harness#role_assignment) for the User Group to complete the ABAC setup.
