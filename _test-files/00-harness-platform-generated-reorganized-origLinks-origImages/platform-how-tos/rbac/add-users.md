A Harness User is any individual registered with Harness with a unique email address. A User can be a part of multiple Accounts.

This topic will explain the steps to create and manage Users within Harness.

### Before You Begin

* [Learn Harness' Key Concepts](https://ngdocs.harness.io/article/hv2758ro4e-learn-harness-key-concepts)
* [Access Management (RBAC) Overview](/article/vz5cq0nfg2-rbac-in-harness)
* Make sure you have **Manage** Permissions for Users.

### Step: Add New User

You must first invite Users to your Account/Org/Project to add them to User Groups and assign Role Bindings accordingly. For more information on User Groups and Role Bindings, see [Add and Manage User Groups](/article/dfwuvmy33m-add-user-groups) and [Role Assignment](/article/vz5cq0nfg2-rbac-in-harness#role_assignment).

Click **Account Settings**, and click **Access Control**.

Click **New User** in **Users****.** The New User settings appear.

If you have Roles and Resource Groups defined, select the Roles and Resource Groups for this user. To add Roles and Resource Groups, see [Add Roles](https://ngdocs.harness.io/article/tsons9mu0v-add-roles) and [Add Resource Groups](https://ngdocs.harness.io/article/yp4xj36xro-add-resource-groups).

Click **Save**. The user will receive a verification email at the address(es) you provided. When the user logs into Harness, the user creates a password, the email address is verified, and the user name is updated.

You can add up to 50000 users in Harness Non-Community Edition.#### User invites

For any new user that you add to your Harness Account, Org, or Project, Harness checks the following and sends invites accordingly:

1. If your authentication mechanism is set to **Login via a Harness Account or Public OAuth Providers**, the invited user gets an email invitation. The user is added to the **Pending Users** list until the user accepts the invitation.
2. If your authentication mechanism is set to SAML, LDAP, or OAuth, and the feature flag `PL_NO_EMAIL_FOR_SAML_ACCOUNT_INVITES` is enabled, Harness adds the invited user to the Active Users list.  
Harness does not send any emails to the user when this feature flag is enabled.
3. If your authentication mechanism is set to SAML, LDAP, or OAuth, and the feature flag `AUTO_ACCEPT_SAML_ACCOUNT_INVITES` is enabled, Harness sends a notification email to the user and adds the user to the Active Users list.

If you enable both feature flags, the feature flag`PL_NO_EMAIL_FOR_SAML_ACCOUNT_INVITES` takes precedence over the feature flag`AUTO_ACCEPT_SAML_ACCOUNT_INVITES`. Harness does not send any emails to users.### Step: Delete User

Click **Users** under **Access** **Control**.

Click **Delete** on the top right corner to delete a specific user.

* **All**: lists the user's group membership across all the scopes.
* **Account only**: lists the user's group membership only in the Account scope.
* **Organization** **only**: lists the user's group membership in the scope of the selected Organization.
