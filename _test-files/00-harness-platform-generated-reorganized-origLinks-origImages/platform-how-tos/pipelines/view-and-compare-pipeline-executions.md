You can view and compare the compiled Harness Pipeline YAML used for each Pipeline execution.

Comparing Pipeline YAML helps you see what changes took place between executions. This can help with troubleshooting execution failures.

### Before You Begin

* [CD Pipeline Basics](/article/cqgeblt4uh-cd-pipeline-basics)
* [CI Pipeline Basics](/article/3amcd8hn53-ci-pipeline-basics)

### Limitations

* You can only compare YAML from two executions at a time.

### Visual Summary

You can compare Pipeline executions by selecting **Compare YAML**, selecting executions, and clicking **Compare**.

Compiled execution YAML is the Pipeline YAML used in the execution, including all resolved [Runtime Inputs, Expressions](/article/f6yobn7iq0-runtime-inputs), and [variables](/article/lml71vhsim-harness-variables).

In a Pipeline, click **Execution History**.
