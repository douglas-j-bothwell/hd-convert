With Audit Trail in Harness, you can view and track changes to your Harness resources within your Harness account.

The audit data retention period is 2 years. Harness reserves the right to delete audit data after 2 years. You can request a longer retention period by contacting Harness. For example, if you require audit data for legal discoveries, etc, contact Harness and we can help.

This topic shows you how to view Audit Trails for your Harness account.

### Step: View an Audit Trail

You can view Audit Trail data at Account/Org/Project scope. This topic explains how to view Audit Trail data at the account scope.

The events in the scope of accounts will not be displayed if you are viewing the Audit Trail at the Org or Project scope.In Harness, go to **Account Settings**.

Click **Audit Trail**.

The **Audit Trail** page appears, displaying a record for each event that changed the setup of your Harness account, Modules, or Harness entities. By default, Harness shows the Audit logs for the previous 7 days.

It may take a few minutes for events to appear on the Audit Trail. Wait a minute and then refresh your browser if you don't notice an event right away.
