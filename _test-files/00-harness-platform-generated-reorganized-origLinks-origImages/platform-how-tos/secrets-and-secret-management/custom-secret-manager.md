### Before you begin

* [Harness Secret Manager Overview](/article/hngrlb7rd6-harness-secret-manager-overview)

### Permissions

### Important

* Harness Custom Secret Manager is a read-only Secret Manager.
* Harness can read/decrypt secrets, but it cannot write secrets to the Custom Secrets Manager.

### Harness Custom Secret Manager Overview

Harness includes a built-in Secrets Management feature that enables you to store encrypted secrets, such as access keys, and use them in your Harness Account. 

Harness integrates with the following third-party Secret Managers along with a built-in Secret Manager:

* AWS KMS
* AWS Secrets Manager
* Azure Key Vault
* GCP KMS
* HashiCorp Vault

You can also use third-party Secrets Managers that are not integrated with Harness, to store your encrypted secrets. With Harness Custom Secret Manager you can integrate Harness with your third-party Secret Managers and read or access your secrets.

Your Custom Secret Manager uses a shell script that you can execute either on a Delegate or on a remote host which is connected to the Delegate. Harness fetches and reads your secrets from the third-party Secret Manager through this shell script.
