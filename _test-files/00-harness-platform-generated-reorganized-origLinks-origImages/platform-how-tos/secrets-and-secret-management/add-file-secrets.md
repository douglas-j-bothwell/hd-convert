You can upload encrypted files and use them in your resources like Pipelines and Connectors, in the same way as encrypted text.

### Step 1: Add Encrypted File

This topic assumes you have a Harness Project set up. If not, see [Create Organizations and Projects](https://ngdocs.harness.io/article/36fw2u92i4-create-an-organization).

You can add an encrypted file at Project/Organization/Account scope. To do this, go to Project setup, Organization, or Account Resources.

Click **Secrets**.

Click **Secret** and select **File.**

Enter a name for the encrypted file. You will use this name to reference the file in your resources.

Click **Browse** to locate and add a file. The default Secrets Manager for your account is used to encrypt the file.

Enter **Description** for your secret.

Enter **Tags** for your secret.

Click **Save.**

### Step 2: Reference the Encrypted File by Name

You can reference the encrypted file in any resource that uses files.

For example, in the following **Configuration and Authentication** dialog, click **Create or Select a Secret** under Select or Create a SSH Key File:

For an Encrypted File secret at the Project scope, you reference the secret in a Resource using its identifier and the expression: 


```
<+secrets.getValue("file-secret-Id")>
```
The identifier is immutable and is located in the secret settings:

```
<+secrets.getValue("org.file-secret-Id")>
```
If your secret is scoped at the Account level, you can refer it using `account`:


```
<+secrets.getValue("account.platformSecret-Id")>
```
