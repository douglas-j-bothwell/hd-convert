The build farm has access to VCS (git), artifact repository to get dependencies for building the artifacts. The delegate receives the job details from Harness which could be on-prem or SaaS-based. The delegate allocates resources on customer provided build farm and runs build jobs. The delegate &amp; build farm will be sending periodic status, logs and metrics to Harness which will be used for DAG orchestration, debugging, health-check, analytics, notifications, and ML model generation. The build farm finally stores the built docker images, release artifacts to customer desired registry and/or storage. </p><p></p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/i5nl071jo5/articles/3jwkrzywpa/1609202556437/image.png"/></figure><p></p><h3>[What Is X?]</h3><p>...</p><h3>[How Does X Do Y?]</h3><p>...</p><h3>Next Steps</h3><p>Read the following topics to build on what you&#39;ve learned:</p><ul><li>link</li><li>link</li></ul><p></p>
