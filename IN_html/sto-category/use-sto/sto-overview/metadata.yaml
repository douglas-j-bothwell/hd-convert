    see all target baselines in the project, go to <strong>Security Tests</strong>
    &gt; <strong>Test Targets</strong>. To see detected issues in a non-baseline target,
    such as a feature or developer branch, go to the build results for that target
    and click <strong>Security Tests</strong>.</p><ul><li><strong>Issue distribution
    over time</strong> — Shows the daily distribution of all detected baseline issues
    by severity.<ul><li>In this context, &#34;daily&#34; means from midnight GMT to
    midnight GMT.</li><li>The STO deduplicates issues with the same root cause. Suppose
    codebase A (main branch) and codebase B (main branch) contain the same vulnerability
    inherited from the same open-source library. In this case, STO combines them into
    one issue.</li></ul></li><li> <strong>Today&#39;s Snapshot</strong> — Shows all
    issues detected in the most recent scans of each target baseline in the project.<ul><li>Suppose
    the most recent baseline scans ran this morning (codebase A), last week (image
    B), and two weeks ago (host C). In this case, the snapshot values are based on
    all baseline issues detected in all three scans.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Target
    Baselines</strong> — Shows the most recent scan for each target baseline in the
    project.</li><li><strong>Failed Builds</strong> — Shows the most recent failed
    builds that included scans of target baselines.</li><li><strong>Active Builds</strong>
    — Shows active builds that include scans of target baselines.</li></ul><p></p>
