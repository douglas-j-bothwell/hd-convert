Over the past decade, Drone has flourished through its vibrant open source community with over 100m pulls on DockerHub, 50,000+ active users, and 250+ contributors.

Drone was acquired by Harness in 2020 and is now part of [Harness CI](https://harness.io/products/continuous-integration).

See [Harness Acquires CI Pioneer Drone.io and Commits to Open Source](https://harness.io/blog/featured/harness-acquires-ci-pioneer-drone-io-and-commits-to-open-source/) and [Lavasoft Reduces Developer Toil by 94% Using Drone and Harness](https://harness.io/customers/case-studies/reduce-developer-toil/).

Together with Drone, Harness provides a CI/CD platform that's both simple and powerful for engineers to deliver software.

Harness CI is built to eliminate engineer toil, scripting, version dependencies, time, cost, and complexity. We empower engineers to focus on delivering innovation for their business rather than manually building software delivery pipelines.
