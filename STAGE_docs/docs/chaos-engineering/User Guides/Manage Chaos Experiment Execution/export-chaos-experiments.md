title: Export Chaos Experiments
---

Chaos experiments can be exported to save them for later use. Although simply creating or running an experiment using the Chaos Studio saves it to be later accessed through the **Chaos Experiments** sidebar option, you can also download the experiment as a manifest file to your machine or save it in any ChaosHub.

## Download Experiment Manifest File
To download the manifest file for an experiment, select the **Chaos Experiments** sidebar option. Here you can access all the experiments that have been only created or have been run in the past.

To export an experiment, select the **`⋮`** icon against the name of the experiment and select **Download Experiment**. This will download the experiment file to your machine.

You can directly upload this manifest file while creating a new experiment to use it as a template for the new experiment. Otherwise, a better way to save, manage, and distribute the experiments as templates is using ChaosHub.

## Add Experiment to ChaosHub
To add an experiment to ChaosHub, again select the **`⋮`** icon against the name of the experiment and select **Add to Chaos Hub**. Then, add an experiment name, optionally a description and a category tag, and lastly choose the ChaosHub to add the experiment to from the list of added ChaosHubs.

Select **Save**. Now, you should be able to see this experiment added to your ChaosHub. You can access it and use it as a template for your new experiments.
