Your pipelines can be managed purely through Git as well.<br/>Pipelines are triggered manually in the Harness Manager or automatically in response to Git events, schedules, new artifacts, and so on.<br/>Harness Manager is available either as SaaS (running in the Harness cloud) or as self-managed (running in your infrastructure).</li><li><strong>Harness Delegate:</strong> The Harness Delegate is a software service you install in your environment. It connects to the Harness Manager and performs tasks using your container orchestration platforms, artifact repositories, monitoring systems, etc. The Delegate is key to enabling Harness to perform CI/CD tasks, but you don&#39;t need to install it right away. You can install the Delegate as part of the flow when setting up your Pipelines or Connectors.
