Grouping by resource group name shows the cost of various resource groups present in your account.</li><li><strong>Meter category</strong>: This is the cost of the meter, for example, Cloud services, Networking, etc.</li><li><strong>Meter subcategory</strong>: This is the cost of the subcategory of meter, for example, A6 Cloud services, ExpressRoute (IXP), etc.</li><li><strong>Resource GUID</strong>: The cost of your Resource GUIDs. The Resource GUID is a unique alphanumeric string that represents each resource for programming purposes.</li><li><strong>Meter</strong>: Cost of the resources&#39; usage.  The meters track the resources&#39; usage and generate a usage record that is used to calculate your bill. For example, you provision a virtual machine in Azure. Some meters that track its usage include: Compute Hours, IP Address Hours, Data Transfer In, Data Transfer Out, Standard Managed Disk, Standard Managed Disk Operations, Standard IO-Disk, Standard IO-Block Blob Read, Standard IO-Block Blob Write, Standard IO-Block Blob Delete.</li><li><strong>Resource type</strong>: The cost of resource instances.</li><li><strong>Service name</strong>: Cost of Azure service, for example, Virtual Machines, Azure App Service, Azure DNS, etc.</li><li><strong>Service tier</strong>: This is the cost of Azure services having service tiers. For example, VMs, Dv3, and Dsv3.</li><li>If your Azure billing export contains the Azure usage and charges information, then the following details are listed:<ul><li><strong>Subscription name</strong>: Name of the subscription.</li><li><strong>Publisher name</strong>: Publisher for Marketplace services. </li><li><strong>Publisher type</strong>: Type of publisher.
