<p>One of the most impactful ways to reduce spend on Kubernetes infrastructure is to make sure your clusters are optimally sized for the workloads and node pools they run. Harness CCM recommends optimal compute resources for your workloads and node pools to help you reduce costs and improve performance</p><p>Recommendations are produced by analyzing your historical utilization metrics. CCM recommends you choose the optimal resource configuration based on your utilization data and requests metrics of pods.</p><p>This topic describes how CCM computes node pool recommendations and how you can use them to potentially reduce monthly costs.</p><div class="note-callout">Before using recommendations in your cluster environment, ensure that you evaluate their impact thoroughly. The person reviewing the recommendations should be able to understand the impacts identified in the recommendations, as well as the impact on the infrastructure and business.<br/><br/>Using recommendations without proper assessment could result in unexpected changes, such as issues with system performance or poor reliability.</div><h3>Before You Begin</h3><ul><li><a href="/article/ltt65r6k39-set-up-cost-visibility-for-kubernetes">Set Up Cloud Cost Management for Kubernetes</a></li><li><a href="/category/e7k0qds7tw-ccm-perspectives">CCM Perspectives</a></li></ul><h3>Review: How are Node Pool Recommendations Computed?</h3><p>The node pool recommendations are computed by analyzing historical utilization data and requests metrics of Pods. CCM recommends the optimal resource configurations for the Spot and On-demand instances. It uses the following parameters to determine the maximum node counts:</p><ul><li>Total CPUs</li><li>Total memory</li><li>Max CPUs</li><li>Max Memory</li></ul><p>The recommendations are calculated by aggregating the resource utilization and request across all pods running across nodes in the node pool. You can select the number of days to compute recommendations based on the utilization data. The available options are last 1 day, 7 days, and 30 days.</p><p></p><pre>CPU, Memory: Max at a given instant [Aggregated Max(resource Utilization, requests)]</pre><p></p><p>Let&#39;s try to understand how the recommendations are computed using the following example. Assume there are two nodes in a node pool, each with two pods running.</p><p></p><pre>Time Instant 1:<br/>Node1:<br/>  Pod1:<br/>  Util → 2.1 vCPU, Request → 4 vCPU<br/>  Pod2:<br/>  Util → 1.4 vCPU, Request → 1 vCPU<br/><br/>Node2:<br/>  Pod1:<br/>  Util → 1.1 vCPU, Request → 4 vCPU<br/>  Pod2:<br/>  Util → 0.9 vCPU, Request → 1 vCPU<br/><br/>Time Instant 2:<br/>Node1:<br/>  Pod1:<br/>  Util → 2.2 vCPU, Request → 4 vCPU<br/>  Pod2:<br/>  Util → 1.5vCPU, Request → 1 vCPU<br/>Node2:<br/>  Pod1:<br/>  Util → 2.0 vCPU, Request → 4 vCPU<br/>  Pod2:<br/>  Util → 0.3 vCPU, Request → 1 vCPU</pre><p></p><p></p><p>The recommendations are calculated as the following:</p><p></p><pre>Time Instant 1: [ Max (2.1, 4) + Max (1.4, 1)+ Max (1.1, 4)+ Max (0.9,1)] = [4 + 1.4 + 4 + 1] =&gt; 10.4<br/><br/>Time Instant 2: [ Max (2.2, 4) + Max (1.5, 1)+ Max (2, 4)+ Max (0.3,1)] = [4 + 1.5 + 4 + 1] =&gt; 10.5<br/><br/>So the Max CPU recommendation would be: Max (10.4, 10.5) = <strong>10.5 vCPU</strong></pre><p></p><p>Similarly, for memory, nodes will be the max number of nodes in the observation interval.</p><p></p><p>Node pool recommendations also offer the flexibility of tuning the recommendations by setting the resource configuration preferences.

It depends on the time at which CCM receives the utilization data for the workload.</div><p>In <strong>Cloud Costs</strong>, click <strong>Recommendations</strong>.</p><p>The recommendations page displays the following information:</p><p></p><ul><li>A breakdown of all the available recommendations.</li><li><strong>Potential Monthly Savings</strong> across your Kubernetes clusters if you apply the recommendations.</li><li><strong>Forecasted Monthly Spend</strong> across your Kubernetes clusters if you do not apply the recommendations.</li><li><strong>Emissions that can be reduced</strong> and <strong>Potential Carbon Emissions</strong> are features that track greenhouse gas emissions.</li></ul><p>The <strong>Recommendation Breakdown</strong> displays the following information:</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Monthly Savings</strong></p></td><td><p>Potential monthly savings for your resource, if you apply the recommendations.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Resource Name</strong></p></td><td><p>Name of the resource for which CCM displays the recommendation.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Monthly Saving</strong></p></td><td><p>Potential Monthly Savings for the resource, if you apply the recommendations.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Monthly Cost</strong></p></td><td><p>The monthly cost of the recommendation.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Recommendation Type</strong></p></td><td><p>Type of the recommendation for your resource.
