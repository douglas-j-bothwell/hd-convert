<p>Harness SaaS Delegates only need outbound access to the Harness domain name (most commonly, <strong>app.harness.io)</strong> and, optionally, to <strong>logging.googleapis.com</strong>.</p><p>The URL logging.googleapis.com is used to provide logs to Harness support.</p><h3>Harness Manager</h3><p>Users of the Harness Manager browser client need access to <strong>app.harness.io</strong> and <strong>static.harness.io</strong>. This is not a Harness Delegate requirement. It&#39;s simply for users to use the browser-based Harness Manager.</p><h3>Vanity URL</h3><p>If you are using a Harness vanity URL, like <strong>mycompany.harness.io</strong>, you can allowlist it also.</p><h3>Allowlist Harness SaaS IPs</h3><p>The following list is optional. You can allowlist these IPs if needed.</p><pre class="hljs apache">35.201.91.229<br/>162.159.134.64<br/>162.159.135.64<br/>2606:4700:7::a29f:8640<br/>2606:4700:7::a29f:8740</pre><p></p><p>Harness will not change IPs without 30 days notice to all customers.
