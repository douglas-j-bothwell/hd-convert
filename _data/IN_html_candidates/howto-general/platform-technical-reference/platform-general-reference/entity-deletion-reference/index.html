Deleting an entity, such as a Role, impact Users.</p><p>As a result of the connection between entities, deleting an entity can make another entity not able to do its job.</p><p>Harness will warn you if you try to delete an entity that is used by another entity or resource.</p><p>If you try to delete the following entity types, Harness will warn you if the entity is used elsewhere:</p><ul><li>User groups</li><li>Connectors</li><li>Secrets</li><li>Templates</li><li>Infrastructures</li><li>Services</li></ul><p>If the entity is used, Harness will show you where.</p><p>For example:</p><ul><li>A Pipeline that uses a Connector.</li><li>A Connector that uses a Secret.</li></ul><p>Harness provides you with the option to delete the entity from all dependent entities (bulk removal).</p><h3>Permissions</h3><p>The ability to delete an entity depends on the Role permissions you have.
