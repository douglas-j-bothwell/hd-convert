  body: <p>This topic lists the Harness entity retention policy.</p><h3 id="Change-Retention-Policy-not-for-mvp">Retention
    Policy Defaults</h3><p>All Harness entities share the same retention policy. You
    can change the retention policy.</p><p>The default retention policy for deleted
    entities is 6 months. This includes entity Ids. </p><h3>Reduce the Retention Policy</h3><p>You
    can’t reduce the retention policy below the default of 6 months.</p><p>You can
    reduce a policy that is greater than 6 months.</p><p>If you reduce the retention
    policy, it effects existing entities. If existing entities current timestamp is
    longer than the newly defined policy they are removed from Harness.</p><h3>Extend
    the Retention Policy</h3><p>You can extend the retention policy by contacting
    Harness. </p><p>If you extend the retention policy:</p><ul><li>The new retention
    policy applies on all entities. You can’t have different policies per Project,
    Pipeline, etc.</li><li>The new retention policy will affect all existing entities
    and their retention will be extended by the new policy. An extended retention
    policy does not affect newly created entities only.</li></ul><h3>See Also</h3><ul><li><a
