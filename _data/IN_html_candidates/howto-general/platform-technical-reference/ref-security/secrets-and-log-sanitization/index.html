<p>Harness sanitizes deployment logs and any script outputs to mask text secret values.</p><p>First, let&#39;s review secrets in Harness, and then look at how Harness sanitizes logs and outputs to prevent secrets from being exposed.</p><p>In this topic:</p><h3>Review: Secrets in Harness</h3><p>You can create secrets in Harness as described in:</p><ul><li><a href="https://ngdocs.harness.io/article/osfw70e59c-add-use-text-secrets">Add and Reference Text Secrets</a></li><li><a href="https://ngdocs.harness.io/article/77tfo7vtea-add-file-secrets">Add and Reference File Secrets</a></li><li><a href="https://ngdocs.harness.io/article/xmp9j0dk8b-add-use-ssh-secrets">Add SSH Secrets</a></li></ul><p>For text and file secrets, the secrets are stored in the Secrets Manager. For steps to add a Secret Manager, see <a href="https://ngdocs.harness.io/article/bo4qbrcggv-add-secrets-manager">Add a Secret Manager</a>.</p><p>Once a secret is added, you can use other Harness entities instead of settings.</p><p>You can reference an Encrypted Text secret created in the Org <a href="/article/vz5cq0nfg2-rbac-in-harness#scope">scope</a> using the secret <u>identifier</u> in the expression: <code>&lt;+secrets.getValue(&#34;org.your_secret_Id&#34;)&gt;</code>.</p><p>You can reference a file secret created in the Org <a href="/article/vz5cq0nfg2-rbac-in-harness#scope">scope</a> using the expression <code>&lt;+secrets.getValue(“org.file-secret-Id”)&gt;</code>.</p><p>At deployment runtime, the Harness Delegate uses the Secrets Manager to decrypt and read the secret only when it is needed.</p><p>Harness sends only encrypted data to the Secrets Manager, as follows: </p><ol><li>Your browser sends data over HTTPS to Harness Manager. </li><li>Harness Manager relays encrypted data to the Harness Delegate, also over HTTPS. </li><li>The Delegate exchanges a key pair with the secrets manager, over an encrypted connection. </li><li>The Harness Delegate uses the encrypted key and the encrypted secret, and then discards them. The keys never leave the Delegate.</li></ol><div class="note-callout">Any secrets manager requires a running Harness Delegate to encrypt and decrypt secrets. Any Delegate that references a secret requires direct access to the secrets manager.</div><p>You can manage your secrets in Harness using either a Key Management Service or third-party Secrets Managers.</p><h3>Sanitization</h3><h3>Changing Secrets in Scripts and RBAC</h3><h3>Log Sanitizer Detects Exact Matches Only</h3><h3>Secrets 3 Characters Minimum</h3><p></p><p></p>
