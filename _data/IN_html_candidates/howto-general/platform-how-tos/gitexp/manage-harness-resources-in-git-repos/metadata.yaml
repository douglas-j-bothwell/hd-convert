  body: '<div class="note-callout">This version of Harness Git Experience has been
    deprecated. To try out the latest version of Git Experience, see <a href="/article/grfeel98am">Harness
    Git Experience Quickstart</a>.​​​</div><p>Once you have <a href="/article/hzajxmb3oj-enable-git-experience-in-a-project">enabled
    Harness Git Experience</a> in your Project, you can create Pipelines and resources
    and store their YAML files in your Git repo&#39;s branches and folders. Git is
    the single source of truth. The Pipelines and resources are stored in the repo
    first, and then synced with Harness.</p><p>This topic provides an example of adding
    a Connector and storing it in the Git repo set up in the Harness Git Experience
    for the Project. The process is the same for Pipelines and other resources.</p><p>In

    Harness Git Experience on a Project that already has Pipelines and resources.
    You must enable Harness Git Experience on a new Project when you first create
    the Project.</p><p>This is a temporary limitation.</p><h3>Step 1: Create the Resource</h3><p>You
    can&#39;t save Project resources to Git until you have added a SCM to your Harness
    account and enabled Harness Git Experience in your Project.</p><ul><li><a href="/article/p92awqts2x-add-source-code-managers">Add
    Source Code Managers</a></li><li><a href="/article/hzajxmb3oj-enable-git-experience-in-a-project">Enable
    Git Experience in a Project</a></li></ul><p>In your Harness Project, click <strong>Project
    Setup</strong>, and then click <strong>Connectors</strong>. We&#39;ll be adding
    a Connector in this topic, but the process is the same for other resources.</p><p>At
    the top of the page is <strong>All Repositories</strong>.</p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/i5nl071jo5/articles/auqv67yr6x/1624308554527/clean-shot-2021-06-21-at-13-49-03.png"/></figure><p>You
    select the repo and branch here to display the Connectors stored in them. It does
    not affect the repo and branch where you create a new Connector. You will select
    that repo and branch in the Connector settings next.</p><p>Click <strong>New Connector</strong>.</p><p>For
    this example, click <strong>Docker Registry</strong>. The <strong>Docker Registry
    Connector</strong> settings appear.</p><p></p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/i5nl071jo5/articles/auqv67yr6x/1624308509894/clean-shot-2021-06-21-at-13-48-19.png"/></figure><p>Enter
    a name for the Connector, such as <strong>DockerHub Anonymous</strong>.</p><p>In
    <strong>Git Repository Details</strong>, select the repo and branch where you
    want to store this Connector. The repos displayed here are the ones set up in
    <strong>Git Management</strong>.</p><p>Click <strong>Continue</strong>.</p><p>In
    <strong>Docker Registry URL</strong>, enter <code>https://registry.hub.docker.com/v2/</code>.</p><p>In
    <strong>Provider Type</strong>, select <strong>DockerHub</strong>.</p><p>In <strong>Authentication</strong>,
    select <strong>Anonymous</strong>.</p><p></p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/i5nl071jo5/articles/auqv67yr6x/1624308859833/clean-shot-2021-06-21-at-13-54-12.png"/></figure><p>Click
    <strong>Continue</strong>.</p><p>In <strong>Set Up Delegates</strong>, select
    <strong>Connect via any available delegate</strong>. If you need to install a
    Delegate, see <a href="/article/re8kk0ex4k-delegate-installation-overview">Delegate
    Installation Overview</a> or <a href="/article/f9bd10b3nj-install-a-kubernetes-delegate">Install
    a Kubernetes Delegate</a>.</p><p>Click <strong>Save and Continue</strong>.</p><p>The
    <strong>Save Connectors to Git</strong> settings appear. Now you can specify the
    Harness Folder for the Connector&#39;s YAML file.</p><h3>Step 2: Save Connectors
    to Git</h3><p>The Save Connectors to Git settings let you pick the folder, file
    path, filename, and branch for the Connector YAML file and commit.</p><p></p><figure><img
    src="https://files.helpdocs.io/i5nl071jo5/articles/auqv67yr6x/1624310975497/clean-shot-2021-06-21-at-14-29-14.png"/></figure><p>In
    <strong>Save Connectors to Git</strong> you select the folder where you want to
    store the Connector&#39;s YAML file. This is called the Harness Folder.</p><p>The
    <strong>Harness Folder</strong> is the default folder for this Connector. If a
    Pipeline stored in another repo/branch uses this Connector, Harness will use the
    Connector YAML file in this default folder at Pipeline execution.</p><p>In <strong>Harness
    Folder</strong>, select one of the folders set up in the Project&#39;s Git Experience
    settings. See <a href="/article/hzajxmb3oj-enable-git-experience-in-a-project">Enable
    Git Experience in a Project</a>.</p><p>The YAML file for the Pipeline will be
    saved to this folder.</p><p>In <strong>File Path</strong>, enter a name for the
    YAML file, such as <code>DockerHub_Anonymous.yaml</code>. Harness will generate
    a name automatically from the Connector name, but you can add your own.</p><p>To
    enter a subfolder of the Harness Folder you selected, enter the folder name in
    front of the file name like <code>connectors/DockerHub_Anonymous.yaml</code>.</p><p>In
    this example, we use <code>connectors/DockerHub_Anonymous.yaml</code>.</p><p>In
    <strong>Commit Details</strong>, enter a message.</p><p>In <strong>Select Branch
    to Commit</strong>, commit to an existing or new branch.</p><ul><li><strong>Existing
    branch:</strong> you can start a pull request if you like.</li><li><strong>New
    branch:</strong> enter the new branch name. You can start a pull request if you
    like.</li></ul><p>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</p><p>The Connector is saved to
    the repo, branch, folder, and file.</p><p>In your Git repo, locate the branch,
    folder, and file.</p><p>Harness created a <strong>.harness</strong> folder under
    the folder you selected in <strong>Harness Folder.</strong></p><p>If you added
    a folder to <strong>File Path</strong>, open that folder.</p><p>Click the YAML
    file for your Connector. The YAML is displayed.</p><h3>See Also</h3><p>See <a
