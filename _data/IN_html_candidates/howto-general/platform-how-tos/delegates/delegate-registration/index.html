<p>To set up a Harness Delegate, you install the Delegate in your environment and the Delegate automatically registers with your Harness account.</p><p>The Delegate config file (for example, Kubernetes Delegate YAML file) contains your Harness account Id. That&#39;s how the Delegate knows where to register.</p><h3>Installing and Registering Delegates</h3><p>To install a Delegate, follow the steps in the relevant Delegate installation topic, such as <a href="/article/f9bd10b3nj-install-a-kubernetes-delegate">Install a Kubernetes Delegate</a> or <a href="/article/cya29w2b99-install-a-docker-delegate">Install a Docker Delegate</a>.</p><p>Once you have installed the Delegate in your environment, click <strong>Verify</strong> in the Delegate wizard and Harness will verify that it is receiving heartbeats from the Delegate.</p><p></p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/i5nl071jo5/articles/39tx85rekj/1645743199994/clean-shot-2022-02-24-at-14-53-07-2-x.png"/></figure><p>This means Harness is waiting for the Delegate you installed to register.</p><p>Registration can take a few minutes. </p><p>Once the Delegate registers, the <strong>Verify</strong> screen will indicate that the Delegate is running.</p><h3>Verifying Delegate Registration Manually</h3><p>The Verify screen also includes troubleshooting steps. </p><p>Here are a few of the steps for the Kubernetes Delegate.</p><p>Check the status of the Delegate on your cluster:</p><pre class="hljs csharp">kubectl describe pod &lt;your-delegate-pod&gt; -n harness-delegate</pre><p>Check the Delegate logs:</p><pre class="hljs csharp">kubectl logs -f &lt;harness-delegate&gt; -n harness-delegate</pre><p>If the pod isn&#39;t up, you might see the following error in your cluster:</p><pre class="hljs graphql">CrashLoopBackOff: Kubernetes Cluster Resources are not available.</pre><p>Make sure the Kubernetes Cluster Resources (CPU, Memory) are enough.</p><p>If the Delegate didn’t reach a healthy state, try this:</p><pre class="hljs csharp">kubectl describe pod &lt;your-delegate-pod&gt; -n harness-delegate</pre><p></p>
