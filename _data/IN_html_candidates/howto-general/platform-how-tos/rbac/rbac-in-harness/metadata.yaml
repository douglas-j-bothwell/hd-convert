  title: Harness Role-Based Access Control Overview
  description: This topic explains the concept of Harness Role-Based Access Control.
  short_version: This topic explains the concept of Harness Role-Based Access Control.
  body: <p>Access management for resources is a critical function for your Accounts,
    Organizations, and Projects. Harness Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) helps you
    manage who has access to your Harness resources, what they can do with those resources,
    and in what scope they have access.</p><h3>What is Harness Role-Based Access Control?</h3><p>Harness
    RBAC is role-based. This means the permissions to resources are determined by
    the roles assigned to Users, User Groups, and Service Accounts.</p><p>For example,
    certain users may have permission to execute pipelines, whereas other users may
    have permission to view the pipelines but not execute them.</p><p>Harness RBAC
    is an authorization system that provides fine-grained access management of Harness
    resources.</p><p>This video provides a quick overview of how you can manage access
    to your resources using Harness RBAC.</p><details><summary>This video provides
    a quick overview of how you can manage access to your resources using Harness
    RBAC.</summary><div><div class="hd--embed" data-provider="YouTube" data-thumbnail="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vIQfpRrES44/hqdefault.jpg"><iframe

    Summary</h3><p>Here is a quick overview of Harness RBAC:</p><ul><li>The Account
    Administrator invites Users to the Account.</li><li>The Account Administrator
    creates User Groups.</li><li>The Account Administrator creates Service Accounts.</li><li>Role
    Assignments happen on individual Users, User Groups, or Service Accounts.</li><li>Each
    User can be a member of multiple user groups and hence can have multiple role
    assignments.</li><li>Each User Group and Service Account can have multiple role
    assignments.</li><li>You can assign roles at any <a href="#scope">scope</a>.<figure><img

    style="max-height:70%;max-width:70%" data-hd-height="70%" data-hd-width="70%"/></figure></li></ul><h3>Harness
    RBAC Components</h3><ul><li><strong>Users:</strong> These are individual users
    within the Harness system. One User can belong to many user groups.<br/>For more
    information on creating a new User, see <a href="/article/hyoe7qcaz6-add-users">Add
    and Manage Users</a>.</li><li><strong>User Groups:</strong> User Groups contain
    multiple Harness Users. Each User Group has assigned roles. You can create User
    Groups at Account/Org/Project scope.<br/>For more information on creating a new
    User Group, see <a href="/article/dfwuvmy33m-add-user-groups">Add and Manage User
    Groups</a>.</li><li><strong>Service Account</strong><strong>:</strong> A Service
    Account is a set of <a href="/article/tdoad7xrh9">API Keys</a> with a set of permissions
    assigned to them via role assignment. API Keys are used for authenticating and
    authorizing remote services attempting to perform operations in Harness via our
    APIs. API Keys that are part of a Service Account are assigned permissions (equivalent
    to users) that Service Accounts inherit.<br/>For more information on creating
    a new Service Account, see <a href="/article/e5p4hdq6bd-add-and-manage-service-account">Add
    and Manage Service Accounts.</a></li><li><strong>Resource Groups:</strong> A <a
    href="#resource-groups">Resource Group</a> is a set of Harness resources that
    a User or User Group can access. You can create Resource Groups at Account/Org/Project
    scope.<br/>For more information on creating a new Resource Group, see <a href="/article/yp4xj36xro-add-resource-groups">Add
    and Manage Resource Groups</a>.</li><li><strong>Roles:</strong> A <a href="#roles">Role</a>
    is a group of permissions you assign to a User Group. You can create roles at
    Account/Org/Project scope.<br/>For more information on creating a new Role, see
    <a href="https://ngdocs.harness.io/article/tsons9mu0v-add-roles">Add and Manage
    Roles</a>.</li><li><strong>Principal:</strong> A principal can be a <strong>User</strong>,
    <strong>User Group,</strong> or <strong>Service Account</strong> to which you
    provide access. <a href="/article/vz5cq0nfg2-rbac-in-harness#role_assignment">Role
    assignments</a> are done on any of these principals, also known as <strong>Subjects</strong>.<figure><img

    style="max-height:30%;max-width:30%" data-hd-height="30%" data-hd-width="30%"/></figure></li></ul><h3>What
    Can You do with RBAC?</h3><p>Here are a few examples of what RBAC can be used
    for:</p><ul><li>Allow Users, User Groups, or Service Accounts to manage and access
    the resources through the Account/Org/Project Admin role.</li><li>Allow Users,
    User Groups, or Service Accounts to view the resources through the Account/Org/Project
    Viewer role.</li><li>Allow Users, User Groups, or Service Accounts to manage and
    access specific resources through Custom Roles.</li></ul><h3>How Does RBAC Work?</h3><p>The
    way you control access to resources using RBAC is to assign permissions to users
    and groups to manage resources.</p><ul><li>Permissions that you want to assign
    to a User or User Group or a Service Account are grouped together in a Role.</li><li>Resources
    that you want to control access to are grouped together in a Resource Group.</li><li>An
    account administrator assigns a Role and Resource Group to a Principal - User
    or User Group or Service Account. This assignment is called <a href="#role-assignment">Role
    Assignment</a>.</li><li>Role Assignment grants the Principal the permissions from
    the Role on the set of resources in the Resource Group.</li></ul><h3>RBAC Scope</h3><p>Harness
    Accounts allow you to group Organizations and Projects that share the same goal.
    These have their own scope of access.</p><p>In Harness, you can specify scopes
    at three levels:</p><ul><li>Account</li><li>Organization</li><li>Project</li></ul><p>Scopes
    are structured in a parent-child relationship. You can assign roles at any of
    these levels of scope.</p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/i5nl071jo5/articles/vz5cq0nfg2/1650388345217/screenshot-2022-04-19-at-10-41-46-pm.png"
    style="max-height:40%;max-width:40%" data-hd-height="40%" data-hd-width="40%"/></figure><p></p><p>The
    following table shows what it means to add users and resources at different scopes
    or hierarchies:</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Scope</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>When
    to add users?</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>When to add resources?</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Account</strong></p></td><td><p>To
    manage administrative functions or have total access and authority over the whole
    hierarchy, add them to the Account scope.</p></td><td><p>Add resources to the
    Account scope to allow sharing across the entire hierarchy.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Organization</strong></p></td><td><p>To
    have visibility and control over all of the projects within this Org, add users
    to the Org scope.</p></td><td><p>Add resources to the Org scope to allow sharing
    across projects within this Org while isolating from other organizations.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Project</strong></p></td><td><p>To
    manage or contribute to this Project, add users to the Project scope.</p></td><td><p>Add
    resources to the Project scope to provide total control to the Project teams.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><p>To
    know more about Organizations and Projects, see <a href="/article/36fw2u92i4-create-an-organization">Create
    Organizations and Projects</a>.</p><h3>Resource Group</h3><p>A Resource Group
    is a collection of resources that are all managed by the same set of users and
    have the same access control policies.</p><p>Resource Groups can be of two types:</p><ul><li><strong>All
    Resources </strong>– Collection of all the resources of a given type.</li><li><strong>Named
    Resources </strong>– Collection of a specific set of individual resources.</li></ul><figure><img

    style="max-height:70%;max-width:70%" data-hd-height="70%" data-hd-width="70%"/></figure><p>Harness
    includes the following default Resource Groups at each scope:</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Scope</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Resource
    Group</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Description</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Account</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>All
    Resources Including Child Scopes</strong></p></td><td><p>Includes all resources
    within the Account&#39;s scope, as well as those within the scope of the Orgs
    and Projects within the Account.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Account</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>All
    Account Level Resources</strong></p></td><td><p>Includes all resources within
    the Account&#39;s scope. Excludes resources that are within the scope of an Org
    or Project.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Org</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>All
    Resources Including Child Scopes</strong></p></td><td><p>Includes all the resources
    within the Org&#39;s scope, as well as those within the scope of all Projects
    within the Org.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Org</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>All
    Organization Level Resources</strong></p></td><td><p>Include all resources within
    the Org&#39;s scope. Excludes resources that are within the scope of a Project.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Project</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>All
    Project Level Resources</strong></p></td><td><p>Includes all resources within
    the scope of a Project.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>You can also create custom
    resource groups within any scope.</p><p>For more information, see <a href="https://ngdocs.harness.io/article/yp4xj36xro-add-resource-groups">Add
    and Manage Resource Groups</a>.</p><h3>Role</h3><p>A Role is a set of permissions
    that allow or deny specific operations on a specific set of resources. A Role
    defines access to resources within a single scope — Project/Org/Account.</p><p>Harness
    provides the following default roles at the Account, Org, and Project scope:</p><p></p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Scope</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Role</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Account</strong></p></td><td><p>Account
    Admin</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Account</strong></p></td><td><p>Account
    Viewer</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Account</strong></p></td><td><p>Feature
    Flag Manage Role</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Org</strong></p></td><td><p>Organization
    Admin</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Org</strong></p></td><td><p>Organization
    Viewer</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Org</strong></p></td><td><p>Feature Flag
    Manage Role</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Project</strong></p></td><td><p>Project
    Admin</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Project</strong></p></td><td><p>Project
    Viewer</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Project</strong></p></td><td><p>Pipeline
    Executor</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Project</strong></p></td><td><p>Feature
    Flag Manage Role</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><p>For more information,
    see <a href="https://ngdocs.harness.io/article/tsons9mu0v-add-roles">Add and Manage
    Roles</a>.</p><h3>Role Assignment</h3><p>A role assignment consists of the following
    elements:</p><ul><li>Principal</li><li>Role</li><li>Resource Group</li><li>Scope</li></ul><p>Following
    are a few key points for role assignment in Harness:</p><ul><li>Role Assignment
    is nothing but assigning a Role and a Resource Group to a Principal.</li><li>The
    Principal gets access to resources through Role Assignment.</li><li>The Principal
    on which role assignment is done can be an individual User, User Group, or Service
    Account.</li><li>Each Principal can have multiple role assignments.</li><li>Depending
    on where you wish to set up access control, you may assign roles at the Account,
    Org, or Project scope.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/i5nl071jo5/articles/vz5cq0nfg2/1650371751826/screenshot-2022-04-19-at-5-59-19-pm.png"
    style="max-height:70%;max-width:70%" data-hd-height="70%" data-hd-width="70%"/></figure><p></p><p>The
    following list explains the different role assignments with the default roles
    and resource groups:</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Role Assignment (Default
    Role + Default Resource Group)</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Description</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Account
    Admin +</strong> <strong>All Resources Including Child Scopes</strong></p></td><td><p>A

    permissions on Feature Flags and Target Management in the Organizations, and Projects
    within the entire Organization.</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Feature
    Flag Manage Role + All Organization Level Resources</strong></p></td><td><p>A
    User Group with this role assignment has the following permissions:</p><ul><li>Create/Edit
    permissions for Feature Flags and Target Management in the Organization scope
    only.</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Project Admin + All Project Level
    Resources</strong></p></td><td><p>A User Group with this role assignment has the
    following permissions:</p><ul><li>All permissions on all the resources within
    the Project scope.</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Project Viewer + All
    Project Level Resources</strong></p></td><td><p>A User Group with this role assignment
    has the following permissions:</p><ul><li>View permissions on all the resources
    in the Project.</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Feature Flag Manage + All
    Project Level Resources</strong></p></td><td><p>A User Group with this role assignment
    has the following permissions:</p><ul><li>Create/Edit permissions for Feature
    Flags and Target Management within the Project scope.</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Pipeline
    Executor + All Project Level Resources</strong></p></td><td><p>A User Group with
    this role assignment has the following permissions:</p><ul><li>View permission
    on Resource Group, Project, Users, User Groups, and Roles</li><li>View and Access
    permissions on Secrets, Connectors, Environments, Services</li><li>View and Execute
    permissions on Pipelines</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Permissions</h3><p>When
    a Harness User is a member of multiple User Groups, the sum of all the role assignments
    determines the effective permissions for the user.</p><p>For example, let us consider
    a user with the following role assignments:</p><ul><li><strong>Account Admin</strong>
    role for <strong>All Resources Including Child Scopes</strong>.</li><li><strong>Organization
    Viewer</strong> role for <strong>All Resources Including Child Scopes</strong>.</li></ul><p>The
    sum of these role assignments is effectively the <strong>Account Admin</strong>
    role for <strong>All Resources Including Child Scopes.</strong> Therefore, in
    this case, the <strong>Organization Viewer</strong> role for <strong>All Resources
    Including Child Scopes</strong> has no impact.</p><div class="note-callout">By
    default, users will have <strong>View</strong> permissions for all resources at
    all scopes (Account/Org/Project).</div><h3>Blog Post</h3><p>The following blog
