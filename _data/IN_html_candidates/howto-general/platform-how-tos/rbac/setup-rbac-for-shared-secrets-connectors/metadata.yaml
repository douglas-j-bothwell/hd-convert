    create and grant Roles using Resource-level permissions for your Connectors and
    Secrets.</p><p>You can do the following:</p><ul><li>Create Users/Groups.</li><li>Control
    which Users/Groups can access specific Connectors.</li><li>Grant read-only (view)
    access to Users/Groups and forbid them from making any changes to your Connectors.</li></ul><p>This
    topic describes a simplistic (minimal) approach by defining three User Groups
    and assigning the Default Roles and Resource Groups at Project-scope. You can
    also create these at Account/Organization scope. For more on Default Roles at
    Account/Organization/Project scope, see <a href="/article/yaornnqh0z-permissions-reference#default_roles">Default
    Roles</a>.</p><h3>Step 1: Create User Groups</h3><p>Create three User Groups:</p><ul><li>Connector_Viewers</li><li>Connector_Accessors</li><li>Connector_Admins</li></ul><h4>Create
    the Connector_Viewers User Group</h4><p>Add a User Group with the name Connector_Viewers.
    See <a href="/article/dfwuvmy33m-add-user-groups">Add and Manage User Groups</a>
    for specific instructions.</p><p>The members of this group need View permissions
    to Connectors and Secrets. Assign <strong>Project Viewer</strong> Role and <strong>All
    Resources</strong> Resource Group to this group. The users in this group can only
    View the Connectors and Secrets. You can also assign Custom Roles and Resource
    Groups to your User Groups. For more on creating a Custom Role and Resource Group,
    see <a href="/article/tsons9mu0v-add-manage-roles">Add and Manage Roles</a> and
    <a href="/article/yp4xj36xro-add-resource-groups">Add and Manage Resource Groups</a>.</p><h4>Create
    the Connector_Accessors User Group</h4><p>Add a User Group with the name Connector_Accessors.
    See <a href="/article/dfwuvmy33m-add-user-groups">Add and Manage User Groups</a>
    for specific instructions.</p><p>The members of this group need View and Access
    permissions to Connectors and Secrets. Assign Role as <strong>Pipeline Executor</strong>
    and Resource Group as <strong>All Resources</strong> to this User Group. The users
    in this group can View and Access Connectors and Secrets, but cannot Create/Edit
    or Delete them. You can assign Custom Roles and Resource Groups to your User Groups
    as mentioned above.</p><h4>Create the Connector_Admin User Group</h4><p>Add a
    User Group with the name Connector_Admins. See <a href="/article/dfwuvmy33m-add-user-groups">Add
    and Manage User Groups</a> for specific instructions.</p><p>The members of this
    group need Admin permissions to Connectors and Secrets. Assign Role as <strong>Project
    Admin</strong> and Resource Group as <strong>All Resources</strong> to this User
    Group. The users in this group can View, Create/Edit, Delete, and Access Connectors
    and Secrets. You can assign Custom Roles and Resource Groups to your User Groups
    as mentioned above.</p><h3>Step 2: Add Members to the Groups</h3><p>Add members
    to the three User Groups — Connector_Viewers, Connector_Accessor, and Connector_Admins. See <a
    href="/article/dfwuvmy33m-add-user-groups">Add and Manage User Groups</a> for
    specific instructions to invite members to User Groups.</p><h3>Limit Access to
    Specific Connectors</h3><p>By default, when you add Connectors to your Resource
    Group, all the resources of that type get added. Harness RBAC enables you to limit
    access only for specific Connectors/Secrets. For example: you want UserGroup1
    to be able to access only SampleDockerConnector and no other Connectors. </p><p>Perform
    the following steps to do this: </p><ul><li>Create a custom Resource Group and
    add <strong>Connectors </strong>as its<strong> Resource</strong>. See <a href="/article/yp4xj36xro-add-resource-groups">Add
    and Manage Resource Groups</a> for detailed instructions.</li><li>Click <strong>Add
    Connectors</strong> to add SampleDockerConnector as shown below. </li></ul><figure><img

    can now follow the <a href="/article/vz5cq0nfg2/preview#role-assignment">Role
    Assignment</a> process to grant permissions to the specific Users/Group.</li></ul><h3>Next
