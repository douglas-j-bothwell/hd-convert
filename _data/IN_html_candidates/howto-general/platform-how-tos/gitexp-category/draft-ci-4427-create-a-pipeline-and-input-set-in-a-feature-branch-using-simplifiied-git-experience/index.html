<div class="note-callout">Currently, this feature is in Beta and behind the feature flag <code>GIT_SIMPLIFICATION</code>. Contact Harness Support to enable the feature.​</div><p>Simplified Git Experience integrates your Harness Pipelines and resources with your Git repos. Simplified Git Experience enables you to do the following:</p><ul><li>Save a Pipeline and its related Entities, such as Input Sets, in a Git repo rather than the Harness database. Git becomes the &#34;single source of truth&#34; for the Pipeline. Every time you update and save a Pipeline in the Pipeline Studio, Harness checks in the changes into your Git repo.</li><li>Maintain separate versions of your Pipelines and related configs in forks and non-default branches.</li><li>Maintain your codebase and Harness Pipelines in the same Git repo and branch. For example, you can create a release branch with a Harness Pipeline specifically configured for that release.</li><li>You can also maintain your codebase and Harness Pipelines in separate repos, with parallel branches to synchronize your updates.</li><li>Merge Pipeline changes between branches the same way you can with code changes.</li><li>Create Triggers that launch builds when your Pipelines get updated.</li><li>Customize how your Harness config YAMLs are organized in your repo. For example, you can organize your configs into <code>harness-configs/pipelines</code>, <code>harness-configs/input-sets</code>, and so on.</li></ul><p>This topic describes how to set up Triggers and Input Sets in a Pipeline that has Simplified Git Experience enabled.</p><h3>Before You Begin</h3><p>You&#39;ll need the following:</p><ul><li>A Git repo with at least one branch and a Personal Access Token (PAT) for your account. Harness needs the PAT to use the Git platform APIs. The PAT is encrypted using a Harness Secret Manager. Your Git Personal Access Token is stored in your Harness secret and is a private key to which only you have access. This secret cannot be accessed or referenced by any other user.<div class="note-callout">Make sure your repo has at least one branch, such as main or master. For most Git providers, you simply add a README file to the repo, and the branch is created.</div></li><li>A Harness Pipeline with Simplified Git Experience enabled. In this how-to, you will cross-check your updates in both your codebase and in the Harness UI. See <a href="https://newdocs.helpdocs.io/article/grfeel98am/preview" target="_blank">New Harness Git Experience QuickStart</a>. </li></ul><h3>Step 1: Select the Branch</h3><p>When you edit your Pipeline in the Harness UI, you are editing a branched version of that Pipeline. Make sure that you are editing in the correct branch. You can switch branches using the branch picker in the top left.</p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/i5nl071jo5/articles/nfll9xyzol/1654356824432/sim-git-exp-branch-picker.png"/></figure><p></p><details><summary>&#34;The Pipeline does not exist in the selected branch:&#34; What to do</summary><div><p></p><p>If you try to switch into a branch that does not include the Pipeline definition, you will get a message like this:</p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/i5nl071jo5/articles/nfll9xyzol/1654357136516/sim-git-exp-error-pipeline-does-not-exist.png" style="max-height:50%;max-width:50%;display:block;margin-left:0;margin-right:auto" data-hd-height="50%" data-hd-width="50%" data-hd-align="left"/></figure><p>If you see this message, add and commit a version of the Pipeline YAML to the target branch in your repo.</p><p>You can also add the Pipeline in the Harness UI:</p><ol><li>Select a branch that includes the Pipeline YAML.</li><li>Edit your Pipeline with the changes you want to check in to the new branch.</li><li>Click <strong>Save</strong> &gt; <strong>Save Pipeline</strong>.</li><li>In the Save Pipelines dialog, select the branch where you want to save your changes.<br/>You can save to an existing branch or a new branch. You can also choose to save your changes to one branch and then merge them into another.<figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/i5nl071jo5/articles/nfll9xyzol/1654359683930/sim-git-exp-save-pipelines-to-git.png" style="max-height:50%;max-width:50%" data-hd-height="50%" data-hd-width="50%"/></figure></li><li>Click <strong>Save</strong>. Harness saves the updated Pipeline in the selected branch, or creates a Pull Request with your changes.</li><li>If needed, go to your codebase and merge the Pull Request.</li></ol></div></details><h3>Step 2: Set the Codebase (<em>Optional</em>)</h3><p>When you set up your Pipeline, you specify the Git repo where you want to save your Harness Pipeline configs. This is the default codebase for your Pipeline.</p><p>If you want to maintain your Harness configs and codebase in different repos, click the Codebase button (right) and set up the Git repo for your codes. See <a href="https://ngdocs.harness.io/article/mozd8b49td" target="_blank">Create and Configure a Codebase</a>.</p><h3>Step 3: Create an Input Set and Save It to Your Branch</h3><p>When Simplified Git Experience is enabled, your Input Set configs get saved in your repo and branch along with your Pipeline configs. Before you create a Trigger, you need to create one or more Input Sets to use with your Triggers.</p><p>In the Pipeline Editor, check the branch-selector pulldown and verify that you are in the correct branch.</p><p>Click <strong>Input</strong> <strong>Sets</strong> and then <strong>+New Input Set</strong>.</p><p>Specify the <strong>Name</strong>, <strong>Yaml Path</strong>, and <strong>CI Codebase</strong> fields as needed for the selected branch.</p><p>The YAML path should point to a file under the .harness folder in your repo. For example, <code>.harness/input-sets/myInputSet.yaml</code>.</p><p>See also <a href="https://ngdocs.harness.io/article/gfk52g74xt" target="_blank">Run Pipelines using Input Sets and Overlays</a> and <a href="https://ngdocs.harness.io/article/576gjpak61" target="_blank">Built-in CI Codebase Variables Reference</a>.</p><div class="note-callout">You are defining the Input Set for a specific branch in a specific repo. For this reason, the Select Git Connector, Repository, and Git Branch fields are displayed for informational purposes but are not editable.</div><p>Click <strong>Save</strong> and select the branch for the Input Set.</p><p><strong>TBD</strong> IT LOOKS LIKE YOU CAN SAVE THE INPUT SET TO A DIFFERENT BRANCH FROM THE ONE THAT&#39;S ALREADY PRESELECTED (AND NOT EDITABLE). ARE THERE ANY USE CASES FOR DOING THIS?</p><h3>Step 4: Create a Trigger</h3><p>Unlike Pipelines and Input Sets, Triggers are saved in the Harness database and apply to all branches in the codebase. A Trigger receives all webhook payloads sent to its URL. The Trigger processes each payload and starts a build if the payload matches the Conditions defined for that Trigger.</p><p><strong>TBD</strong> I&#39;M TRYING TO EXPLAIN WHY GIT EXPERIENCE IS SUPPORTED FOR PIPELINES AND INPUT SETS BUT NOT FOR TRIGGERS. IS THIS A CONSCIOUS DESIGN DECISION OR SOMETHING WE HAVEN&#39;T GOTTEN AROUND TO SUPPORTING? IT SEEMS LIKE EACH TRIGGER IS ALREADY ASSOCIATED WITH A SPECIFIC BRANCH BECAUSE YOU SPECIFY THE INPUT SETS AND PIPELINE REFERENCE BRANCH IN THE PIPELINE INPUT TAB.</p><p>You can create a &#34;generic&#34; Trigger that can run in any branch, or a Trigger that runs in a specific branch (or subset of branches) only.</p><h4>Generic Trigger (<em>All Branches</em>)</h4><p></p><h4>Branch-Specific Trigger</h4><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>
