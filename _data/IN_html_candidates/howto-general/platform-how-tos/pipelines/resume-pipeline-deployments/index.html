<p>Pipeline execution might fail for many reasons, such as infrastructure changes or changes to resource access. In such cases, rerunning an entire Pipeline can be costly and time-consuming. </p><p>Harness provides an option to resume Pipeline executions from any executed Stage or from the failed Stage. These options enable you to quickly rerun stages after you identify the cause of the failure. </p><div class="note-callout">Retrying a Pipeline or Stage is different from rerunning a Pipeline or Stage. When you rerun, you can select new values for Runtime Inputs. When you retry a Pipeline or Stage, you are running the Pipeline or Stage exactly as it was run before.
