  body: '<p>A Pipeline is an end-to-end process that delivers a new version of your
    software. Each Pipeline has stages that contain the logic to perform one major
    segment of the Pipeline process.</p><p>While executing a Pipeline, you might encounter
    situations where most of the stages succeed, but a few of them fail. Or you might
    want to run only specific Stages. In such situations, Harness lets you select
    specific stages to run instead of executing the entire Pipeline again.</p><p>This
    topic explains how to run specific stages in a Pipeline.</p><p>In this topic:</p><ul><li><a

    Harness&#39; Key Concepts</a></li><li><a href="https://ngdocs.harness.io/article/36fw2u92i4-create-an-organization">Create
    Organizations and Projects</a></li><li><a href="/article/2chyf1acil-add-a-stage#add-a-stage">Add
    a Stage</a></li><li>Make sure you have <strong>Execute</strong> permissions for
    Pipeline to run a specific Stage of the Pipeline. For example, the <a href="/article/yaornnqh0z-permissions-reference">Pipeline
    Executor</a> default role in the Project where your Pipeline is located.</li></ul><h3>Review:
    Dependent and Independent Stages</h3><p>The Services and Environments in a Pipeline
    stage can be propagated to subsequent Stages. Also, the settings of one stage
    such as its variables and step inputs and outputs can be referenced in other Stages
    as expressions.</p><p>See <a href="/article/f6yobn7iq0-runtime-inputs">Fixed Values,
    Runtime Inputs, and Expressions</a>.</p><p>If a Stage uses the settings of another
    Stage, it is a dependent Stage.</p><p>If a Stage does not use the settings of
    any other Stage, it is an independent Stage.</p><p>How you run and rerun Stages
    is different depending on whether the Stage is dependent or independent.</p><p>Let&#39;s
    look at the different options.</p><h3>Step 1: Select Stage Execution Settings</h3><p>To
    run specific stages in your Pipeline, you must allow selective stage(s) execution.</p><p>To
    do this, in your Pipeline click <strong>Advanced Options</strong>.</p><p>In <strong>Stage
    Execution Settings</strong>, set <strong>Allow selective stage(s) executions?</strong>
    to <strong>Yes</strong>.</p><p></p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/i5nl071jo5/articles/95q2sp1hpr/1644601442680/clean-shot-2022-02-11-at-09-43-47.png"/></figure><h3>Option:
    Run Specific Independent Stages</h3><p>This topic assumes you have a Harness Project
    set up. If not, see <a href="https://ngdocs.harness.io/article/36fw2u92i4-create-an-organization">Create
    Organizations and Projects</a>.</p><p>You can <a href="/article/2chyf1acil-add-a-stage#step_1_create_a_pipeline">create
    a Pipeline</a> from any module in your Project, and then <a href="/article/2chyf1acil-add-a-stage#add-a-stage">add
    Stages</a> for any module.</p><p>In your Pipeline, click Run. The Run Pipeline
    settings appear.</p><p>In Stages, select one or more stages in your Pipeline which
    are independent of other stages.</p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/i5nl071jo5/articles/95q2sp1hpr/1636940898394/screenshot-2021-11-15-at-7-17-31-am.png"
    style="max-height:50%;max-width:50%" data-hd-height="50%" data-hd-width="50%"/></figure><p>If
    the selected stage requires any <a href="/article/f6yobn7iq0-runtime-inputs#runtime_inputs">Runtime
    Inputs</a>, you can provide the inputs only for that Stage manually or by selecting
    an input set.</p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/i5nl071jo5/articles/95q2sp1hpr/1636738356923/screenshot-2021-11-12-at-11-01-23-pm.png"
    style="max-height:50%;max-width:50%" data-hd-height="50%" data-hd-width="50%"/></figure><p>You
    can also view the execution details in the Pipeline execution history.</p><figure><img
    src="https://files.helpdocs.io/i5nl071jo5/articles/95q2sp1hpr/1636952333430/screenshot-2021-11-15-at-10-26-55-am.png"
    style="max-height:50%;max-width:50%" data-hd-height="50%" data-hd-width="50%"/></figure><h3>Option:
    Run Specific Dependent Stages</h3><p>If you want to run Stages that propagate
    settings or need inputs from previous Stages as <a href="/article/f6yobn7iq0-runtime-inputs#expressions">expressions</a>,
    you can provide the inputs manually while executing this Stage independently.</p><p>The
    below example shows a Pipeline with 3 stages. Stage2 uses the value of timeout
    in stage1 using an expression. When you run stage2 without executing stage1, this
    expression is evaluated as a runtime input. You can input the value during execution
    and run this Stage independently.</p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/i5nl071jo5/articles/95q2sp1hpr/1638289607458/screenshot-2021-11-30-at-9-55-35-pm.png"
    style="max-height:50%;max-width:50%" data-hd-height="50%" data-hd-width="50%"/></figure><h3>Option:
    Rerun Stage</h3><p>You can rerun an executed Stage by clicking the Rerun Stage
    button and providing any Runtime inputs.</p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/i5nl071jo5/articles/95q2sp1hpr/1636956662207/screenshot-2021-11-15-at-11-35-02-am.png"
