    31, 2022, minor release 76324</h3><p>Delegate version 76324</p><h4>New Features
    and Enhancements</h4><p>This release introduces the following features and enhancements.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Issue</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Description</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>CCM-7649</p></td><td><p>Harness
    API now includes a REST method you can use to list the BI dashboards specific
    to CCM.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p></p><p>CDS-39449</p></td><td><p>A feature was
    added for deployments of type <code>ServerlessAwsLambda</code> to allow the addition
    of Amazon S3 as a primary artifact or a sidecar. You can also add both as Amazon
    S3 artifacts. (CDS-39449)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p></p><p>CDS-40651</p></td><td><p>Entry
    of the Kustomize YAML Folder path that is used to fetch the Kustomize manifest
    has been simplified. Enable the <code>NG_OPTIMIZE_FETCH_FILES_KUSTOMIZE</code>
    feature flag to reveal a checkbox (Optimized Kustomize Manifest Collection) in
    the <strong>Advanced</strong> section of <strong>Manifest details</strong>. Select
    the checkbox to render the input required for the Kustomize YAML Folder path.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>CDS-41025</p></td><td><p>There
    were changes to the YAML specified in the Kustomize application manifest for the
    Harness file store. These include the following:</p><p>The base path must be configured
    inside the <code>store</code> element, as follows:</p><details><summary>Example
    store</summary><div><pre class="hljs yaml">store:<br/>    type: Harness<br/>    spec:<br/>      files:<br/>          -account:/kustomize</pre></div></details><p>The
    relative Kustomization YAML path must be configured as part of the <code>spec</code>:</p><details><summary>Example
    spec</summary><div><pre class="hljs yaml">spec:<br/>    overlayConfiguration:<br/>        kustomizeYamlFolderPath:
    multipleEnv/environments/production<code><br/></code></pre></div></details></td></tr><tr><td><p>PL-21667</p></td><td><p>Accounts
    list with greater speed during transitions from one to another.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h4>Issues
    Fixed in This Release</h4><ul><li>The RDS inventory dashboards did not reflect
    the updated DBInstanceClass when RDS instance class was updated. The RDS Inventory
    dashboard now displays the updated instance-class as expected. A data discrepancy
    that occurred because of an error in the join condition of the looker query was
    fixed. (CCM-8484, ZD-33142)</li><li>The Perspective Preview section was changed
    to ensure that the correct table is queried. A check was added, on whether it&#39;s
    a cluster perspective, before the query is issued. (CCM-8484)</li><li>Code was
    changed to add a check for a null value when converting conditions values to filter
    values. This resolves an issue in which <code>&#39;label.key IN {&#34;&#34;]&#39;
    -&gt; Empty Array</code> is set to <code>null</code>. (CCM-8558)</li><li>The <strong>Select
    Manifest</strong> modal now has the same width when moving from <strong>Select
    a Manifest Reference</strong> to <strong>Configure Manifest Runtime Inputs</strong>.
    (CDS-37913)</li><li>Fixed the start and end time for Approval steps. (CDS-38899)</li><li>Added
    scope information to allow for the comparison of the YAML in an updated template.
    (CDS-38936)</li><li>Fixed step iteration logic for update/save step based on `Steps/RollbackSteps`
    state allowing same identifiers. (CDS-39753)</li><li>Infrastructure was not getting
    updated on change of environment. This was because the environment value was not
    discarded and dependencies were not updated. (CDS-39946)</li><li>Added validation
    to run-time input when executing a pipeline. (CDS-40040)</li><li>Earlier different
    versions of template were allowed to be on different template types and child
    types. For example, <em>t1, v1</em> template could be a stage template while <em>t1,
    v2</em> could be a step template. This scenario should no longer occur. (CDS-40077)</li><li>Corrected
    the deployment type for the Apply step values.yaml file. (CDS-40140)</li><li>Fixed
    the incorrect specification of a variable name. Changed the type for &#34;Canary
    Deployment.&#34; (CDS-40177)</li><li>Infrastructure as runtime was not being honored
    when the environment was runtime (CDS-401188)</li><li>Fixed a path error that
    affected the workload field in the Scale step. (CDS-40198)</li><li>Improved the
    user experience for long cluster names. (CDS-40393)</li><li>Resolved a problem
    with missing environment group access permissions. There was an RBAC issue that
    did not allow users to execute a pipeline with environment groups. (CDS-40440)</li><li>Modified
    error messages to provide better information in cases where an artifact cannot
    be selected in the trigger creation screen. (CDS-40499)</li><li>Removed an old
    condition in the code for `Execution` tab check because this is being checked
    by <code>!serviceDefinition</code> check and no longer prevents pipeline templates
    strategies. (CDS-40559)</li><li>The default deployment type for Azure Web Apps
    has been set to canary. (CDS-40560)</li><li>Set the pipeline <code>executionId</code>
    to be the same as the ID of previous instances instead of being set to <code>AUTO_SCALED</code>.
    (CDS-40562)</li><li>Corrected an issue to ensure counting approval rejected pipeline
    execution as failed. (CDS-40563)</li><li>Added a delay on API response. (CDS-40858)</li><li>The
    infrastructure tab now shows the correct Help panel and provides information.
    (CDS-40879)</li><li>You can now save WinRm Credentials without adding a port;
    it saves to default NTLM, Kerberos port. (CDS-40955)</li><li>Additional Safety
    checks added if someone still reaches on the triggers page in service v2 . (CDS-41133)</li><li>Fixed
    stage selection pop-up for pipeline templates. (CDS-41193)</li><li>When stages
    are in parallel, and <code>imagePath</code> is an expression, tags were not coming
    up. This issue is fixed. (CDS-41612)</li><li>Added a minor text change on the
    get started with CIE page. (CI-4748)</li><li>On NG task failures, if descriptions
    are available for the errors that are generated, the appropriate description is
    displayed instead of a generic message. It&#39;s usually set when there are no
    eligible delegates to execute task. (DEL-3933)</li><li><code>INSTALL_CLIENT_TOOLS_IN_BACKGROUND</code>
    environment variable was preventing from client tools to be detected when their
    download is disabled. This is now fixed. (DEL-4246)</li><li>Fixed an issue with
    the upgrader not running because of missing permissions. Also corrected an issue
    that caused the upgrader to fetch latest mutable delegate version when ran, this
    latest mutable version replaced immutable delegate running installed using Helm.
    No changes should be required on the user side since the Helm Delegate was not
    yet released. (DEL-4472)</li><li>Any Feature Flag saved within a pipeline step
    should now be selected and available in the list of available flags, including
    if the flag is not located in the first 15 flags retrieved from the server. (FFM-3716)</li><li>Fixed
    a line-break issue. Long nonbreaking strings will now break onto a new line instead
    of overflowing in the flag variation value. (FFM-4010)</li><li>Fixed an issue
    that caused the display of a no-environment tool tip. (FFM-4094)</li><li>The user
    should no longer be able to name and/or describe a ff stage when creating a template.
    This should only happen when they create a pipeline stage using the template.
    (FFM-4098)</li><li>The timeout field did not fill with a default value when it
    is left empty when a fixed value is not set during design time. (PIE-3687)</li><li>Updated
    tabs retention condition based on user selected tab information stored in query
    params (PIE-3977)</li><li>Padding of the listed sections was nested one level
    under the root which should not have been the case. The padding has now been updated.
    (PIE-4588)</li><li>Environment templates did not read the right values in the
    run pipeline form / input set views. (PIE-4596)</li><li>Fixed issue with Gitlab
    connectors not being able to be used within the yaml as they had a casing issue.
    Gitlab changed to GitLab. (PIE-4618, ZD-32734)</li><li>Unsaved changes warning
    will not appear after this change. Save button will not be enabled if no changes
    are made to ShellScript step fields. (PIE-4623)</li><li>Formik values is wrapped
    with pipeline key for Tags api call. (PIE-4631)</li><li>Removed the even propagation
    stop and updated the dimensions function (PIE-4644)</li><li>Fixed polling on execution
    of the list view. (PIE-4751)</li><li>Fixed a typographic error. Changed the first
    letter of the error message to be capitalized. (PL-21354)</li><li>Layout component
    was implemented incorrectly. Fixed by updating the height calculation.Now the
    pages will take their min-height from the larger of two values: the height of
    the nav and the height of the screen. (PL-24388)</li><li>Added error handling
    with more verbose statements when any CRUD operation fails in AWS secret manager.
    (PL-24942)</li><li>Bug was arising since the latest status was not being considered
    by the component and showing default red status (PL-25666)</li><li>Sometimes user
    was redirected back to login page after a successful login. This used to happen
    when the user got logged out due to an expired token.This issue is fixed now,
    and login should work in one go, no matter how you got logged out. (PL-26302)</li><li>The
    additional field &#34;K8s Auth endpoint&#34; was coming in all types of vault
    and this issue is resolved in this ticket .The problem was we added this field
    and set the default value as a constant. When we were mapping the Vault object
    to DTO, we missed an if condition to specify that this field should appear only
    in case of k8s auth.This issue has been resolved. Now we will not see this field
    in other auth methods of vault. (PL-26600, ZD-32625)</li><li>TooltipProp which
    is present is removed and a new HarnessDocTooltip is passed which makes the Alignment
    proper. And also the information icon is aligned centre. (PL-26644)</li><li>The
    Input set error experience did not show the error response that we received from
    the BE. We were not sending error prop to the error page. Simply passing that
    prop resolved the issue. (PL-26686)</li><li>Repo details is showing in background
    ,when run pipeline using inputset selection (PL-26706)</li><li>We were not sending
    the namespace as header when we are trying to login using the k8s Auth. Added
    this field in as a header when calling vault. (PL-26919, ZD-32763)</li><li>Corrected
    code to ensure that a green container registry connector remained green when selected
    in the pipeline. (PL-26951)</li><li>Fixed Vault connector creation at the organization
    level when no account level delegate are present. (PL-27140, ZD-32981)</li><li>For
    existing Vault Sm&#39;s, the field useK8sAuth will not be present. Issue occurred
    here when we are using this field directly rather than using a getter function
    to handle that null check. Modified the use case and used the getter function
    there. Also added a UT to handle this case when this field is having null. (PL-27259)</li><li>The
    sequence in which services are deleted when project is deleted was incorrect.Now
    while deleting the project we can see both Monitored service and SLO audits. (SRM-11140)</li><li>The
    request body for custom log source was not getting serialised properly due to
    the treatment of numbers in Gson library which we use. By upgrading the version
    of the library, we now have support to customise this behaviour. Now we have defined
    how a number will be deserialised. This issue is now resolved. (SRM-11217)</li></ul><h3>July

    and Delegate</h4><p>The following new features were added to the Harness platform
    components:</p><ul><li>Harness has released a new simplified Git Experience. (PL-24308)<ul><li>How
    to create a Pipeline using Git Experience. See <a href="https://ngdocs.harness.io/article/grfeel98am">Harness
    Git Experience QuickStart</a>.</li><li>How to create Input Sets and Triggers using
    Git Experience. See <a href="https://ngdocs.harness.io/article/8tdwp6ntwz">Manage
    Input Sets and Triggers in Git Experience</a>.</li><li>How to manage your Harness
    Pipelines and Input Sets in a separate repo from your code. See <a href="/article/5nz7j3e1yc-manage-a-harness-pipeline-repo-using-git-experience">Manage
    a Harness Pipeline Repo Using Git Experience</a>.</li></ul></li><li>Improved console
    view for stages. (PIE-3886)</li><li>Added support for adding cloning pipelines.
    (PIE-3878, PIE-3819)</li><li>Secret cache in NG has been revamped to store Encryption
    details. These details are being fetched from NG manager via rest api call from
    CG manager, which increases latency during task queuing. With this cache, we will
    substantially reduce this latency. (DEL-4288)</li><li>Added search by delegate
    tags functionality in UI (DEL-4230)</li><li>Delegate entities will be hard deleted
    on deleting parent org/project. And users will be able to recreate with the same
    identifier. (DEL-4202)</li><li>Add the support of scoping single delegate to an
    environment or pipeline or stage. (DEL-4159)<br/>For CD pipelines, introducing
    the option to add delegate selectors at pipeline level, stage level and step group
    level along with existing step level and connector level.<br/>With this change
    in place task selectors are chosen with a clearly defined hierarchy applied.The
    priority will be (in order of precedence): Delegates selectors at Step level &gt;
    Delegates selectors at stage &gt; Delegates selectors at pipeline &gt; Delegate
    selectors at Connectors.</li><li>On the delegate list page, adding the ability
    to do partial search with tag names as well as introducing a new filter option
    with delegate tags to search. (DEL-4151)</li><li>Improved the logic of delegate
    token validation to make it more performant (DEL-3998)</li><li>Removed <code>io_netty_netty</code>
    dependency from delegates (DEL-3798)</li></ul><h4>Pipeline</h4><ul><li>New support
    for adding cloning pipelines. (PIE-4262)</li></ul><h4>Continuous Integration</h4><ul><li>We
    now support builds for MacOs VM&#39;s from CI. See <a href="https://ngdocs.harness.io/article/mwzlb0x2mt"
    target="_blank">Define a MacOS Build Infrastructure in AWS</a>. (CI-4368)</li><li>Users
    can now use Azure Repos connectors in pipeline codebase configuration and triggers.
    (CI-4825)</li><li>Updated VM icon. (CI-4630)</li><li>The &#34;Build&#34; filter
    now includes Dashboards with Test Intelligence panels added. (CDB-233)</li></ul><h4>Continuous
    Deployment</h4><ul><li>Deleting Orphaned Resources During K8s Deployment feature
    is now behind the Feature Flag <code>PRUNE_KUBERNETES_RESOURCES_NG</code> (CDS-39364)</li><li>Supporting
    AWS Connector with Cross-account access (STS) for Serverless Swimlane (CDS-39010)</li><li>Supporting
    AWS Connector with credential types( Assume IAM role on Delegate and Use IRSA)
    for Serverless Swimlane. (CDS-38924)</li><li>After adding multiple artifact support,
    we support the following expressions in serverless YAML, to include the following
    artifacts. (CDS-38895)<ul><li>For Primary Artifact:<ul><li>Artifactory → <code>&lt;+artifact.path&gt;</code></li><li>ECR
    → <code>&lt;+artifact.image&gt;</code></li></ul></li><li>For Sidecar Artifacts:<ul><li>Both
    Artifactory and ECR → <code>&lt;+sidecar.artifact.identifierName&gt;</code>   <br/>Where
    identifierName is the identifier which customer gives when specifying a sidecar
    artifact in the pipeline</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Allow adding of ECR artifact
    for serverless stage (CDS-38857)</li><li>Support for Azure deployments using cluster
    user <code>kubeconfig</code>. (CDS-38131)</li><li>These are the assumptions/expectations
    for AKS cluster config:<ul><li>AKS managed AAD (enabled or disabled)</li><li>Kubernetes
    RBAC enabled</li><li>Azure RBAC (enabled or disabled): See <a href="https://ngdocs.harness.io/article/sjjik49xww-kubernetes-cluster-connector-settings-reference#deployments_cd"

    Fixed in This Release</h3><ul><li>Fixed issue with Datadog metric collection.
    (SRM-1104, ZD-32514)</li><li>Verification is not happening correctly when we configure
    MS using templates. Verify step for Template type monitored service was not working
    due to a missing record in the database. For such use cases, we use a transient
    entity. Updated to code to support both transient and persisted entities. (SRM-11097)</li><li>Data
    Collection for CustomLogs is failing in Verification step (SRM-11003)<br/>The
    Custom Log Health Source feature was unable to collect and process the data in
    the Verify step. This feature uses different DSL scripts to collect log data and
    service instance (host) data. If the log data collection DSL can also provide
    the host data, we do not need the host data DSL explicitly. However, in this case,
    the log collection DSL was also being used to collect the host data, which led
    to a Type mismatch error during the data processing. By removing the use of log
    collection DSL as the host collection DSL, we are able to pull the host data from
    the log data itself and it also ceases the exception. This feature is now working
    correctly.</li><li>Creation of Custom Health Source Metrics for Service based
    is failing (SRM-11002)<br/>The Custom Metric Source Health did not work if the
    data query type was of type Service. The issue was happening due to a validation
    on the field metricPath in the Json response mapping, which is not present for
    the given query type. The given field is now optional. This issue has been resolved.</li><li>Deployment
    Stage template CV not working (SRM-10934)</li><li>Email Notification is failing
    with invalid template message. Add the body into a string and also add HTML tags.(SRM-10923)</li><li>Reset
    perpetual task for Prometheus for authentication. (SRM-10896)</li><li>Fixed an
    issue in creating perpetual task in case of compatibility issues. (SRM-10829)</li><li>Prometheus
    verification failing logs unhelpful. (SRM-10716)</li><li>Fix PreQA startup failing
    because of JDK11 update (SRM-10709)</li><li>Negative Value Validation required
    at backend for notification-rule/{identifier} API added NULL checks (SRM-10682)</li><li>Fixed
    a null pointer exception in data collection for verify step. (SRM-10674)</li><li>Incorrect
    order of events in verify step&#39;s log cluster view. fixed sorting orders. (SRM-10665)</li><li>Fixed
    sorting orders. (SRM-10656)</li><li>Yaml added for Prometheus connector with username
    and password. (SRM-10653, ZD-31038)</li><li>Notifications are triggered even when
    analysis is OFF (SRM-10652)</li><li>Add exception if a different NotificationRuleType
    is added into a different Entity (SRM-10632)</li><li>Two APIs are failing in Verify
    Step for customappd health source. Added NULL checks. (SRM-10631)</li><li>Not
    able to create an SLO with GCP as metrics (SRM-10594)</li><li>Show exception to
    users when save fails for metric data collection. (SRM-10551, ZD-30562)</li><li>Fixed
    a bug in cloudwatch EC2 timeseries analysis which was causing analysis to finish
    without any actual analysis. (SRM-10276, ZD-30292)</li><li>Changed metricIdentifier
    and metricName position in constructor (SRM-10161)</li><li>Fixed issue where users
    could not add custom metrics values and charts. (SRM-10099)</li><li>Can not set
    CCM license start date via API . (PLG-1344)</li><li>Fixed update file use-case
    for Git Sync Experience via Bitbucket cloud.<br/>Creating and updating file in
    Git Sync via Bitbucket cloud works fine. When we do some commits on unrelated
    files on git, then head of the branch moves ahead of the last commit on file.
    This results in failure of update of file via Harness UI. (PL-26564, ZD-32559)</li><li>Fixed
    issue with branch listing. (PL-26275)</li><li>The update of an Azure Connector
    didn&#39;t work in a Git Experience-enabled project. The issue has been resolved.
    The Azure Connector can now be updated for a Git Experience-enabled project. (PL-26216,
    ZD-32129)</li><li>Fixed issue: in audit log filter, &#34;Updated&#34; appears
    twice. Changed &#34;Updated&#34; to &#34;Upserted.&#34; (PL-25660)</li><li>When
    a secret starts with or ends with a space, the sanitization of secret does not
    work as per current implementation. Modified that. Now this case will be handled.
    (PL-25784)</li><li>Missed a few Account viewer roles in Migration. (PL-25758)</li><li>Account
    Viewer role is not visible for Role Assignment on User Invite (PL-25742)</li><li>Prevented
    G-zipping of video files on CDN. Also, for CDN cache invalidation, changed the
    hashes of files. (PL-25539)</li><li>Subscription MAUs and Developer Count Reversed
    (PLG-1239)</li><li>Subscription Prices Endpoint Should Use ModuleType enum (PLG-1192)</li><li>Getting
    branch name empty error while fetching pipeline from default branch (PL-25914)</li><li>The
    casing of the word &#34;Connectors&#34; has been changed in the autocomplete dropdown
    in order to be consistent with API when the user tries the following endpoint: <code>https://harness.io/docs/api/tag/Connectors#operation/getConnectorListV2!ct=application/json&amp;path=filterType&amp;t=request</code> (PL-25424)</li><li>The
    API (listConnectorByFQN) now correctly return back all the available connectors.
    In case the connector is git synced, the connector from the default branch is
    returned as part of response list. (PL-25364, ZD-30901)</li><li>We updated open
    api spec typo to change SecretFileSpe to SecretFileSpec. This won&#39;t have any
    change in API but will have change if someone was using autogenerated client.
    (PL-25360)</li><li>In case no project was saved in PreferenceFramework (because
    it&#39;s disabled currently), DeleteProject was throwing an error as it was trying
    to access an &#39;undefined&#39; project (PL-25337)</li><li>Earlier duplicate
    redis events (like referring to a connector in 2 stages of the same pipeline)
    was giving a bulk update exception, which lead to none of the instances being
    stored. Now we are checking for duplicates and storing only one instance. (PL-25264)</li><li>Fixed
    issue: Audit Trail showing incorrect timezone. (PL-24878)</li><li>Your preferred
    default experience will now be used to redirect you to the correct version when
    you open <code>app.harness.io</code>. (PL-24779)</li><li>Publish audit is failing
    in PROD when the new YAML size is greater than the defined size. (PL-24426)</li><li>Replaced
    numbers with Previous and Next buttons. (PL-23978)</li><li>Added a global check
    to redirect User to login page when IP is not whitelisted. (PL-23816)</li><li>Inline
    creation of connector is removed from UI when user lacks permissions to create
    a connector. (PL-21623)</li><li>Unexpected behavior on clicking the popup message
    in connectors page. (PL-21534)</li><li>Added new email validations. (PIE-4394)</li><li>Fixed
    issue: Unable to view execution view of pipeline when retrying a failed pipeline.
    (PIE-4334)</li><li>Pipelines with Deploy stage templates are not listed on the
    Pipelines listing page​. (PIE-4298, ZD-29735, ZD-32185)</li><li>Updated the condition
    to show conditionalExecution icon on stages. (PIE-4277)</li><li>Removed matrix
    parent nodes from execution console view list. (PIE-4271)</li><li>Fixed issue:

    the right. (PIE-4097)</li><li>Fixed issue: Input set YAML filepath is missing
    when saving a new pipeline. (PIE-4088)</li><li>Added validation: Input set name
    is now mandatory. (PIE-4085)</li><li>Fixed issue: Dynamic popover is mounted even
    after the onMouseLeave event. (PIE-4080)</li><li>Method field will not be empty
    when we come back from YAML view after saving the fields. (PIE-3952)</li><li>Removed
    additional Back button. (PIE-3949)</li><li>Removed extra data from drag payload

    when &#34;byInstances&#34; is chosen. (PIE-3563)</li><li>The stage deletion modal
    did not show a proper warning message when deleting a parent stage. Parent stage
    is a stage that is being propagated to other stages. Fixed the issue by adding

    information regarding certificates and Delegate upgrade to OpenJDK 11<br/><br/></strong>As
    part of our migration to OpenJDK 11, Delegates will download OpenJDK 11 and get
    started with it instead of the previous OpenJDK 8 that was used. This means that
    Delegates will have Java installed on a different path. Any user actions which
    modify or use older Java versions would be affected. Some of the most common scenarios
    include adding certificates to the default Java keystore and running additional
    Java applications using Delegates installed Java (e.g. from a profile or init
    script).<br/><br/>See <a href="https://community.harness.io/t/information-regarding-certificates-and-delegate-upgrade-to-openjdk-11/12074"
    target="_blank">Information regarding certificates and Delegate upgrade to OpenJDK
    11</a>.<br/></div><h4>New Features and Enhancements</h4><p>The following new features
    were added to the Harness platform components:</p><h5>Feature Flags</h5><ul><li>Enabled
    Advanced tab in all pipeline steps in the Feature Flags Pipeline Studio (FFM-3324).</li></ul><h5>Continuous
    Integration</h5><ul><li>Support runtime input for Codebase configuration now supports
    runtime inputs. (CI-3648)</li></ul><h5>Continuous Deployment</h5><ul><li>Changed
    return type of an newly introduced API endpoint to be aligned with already existing
    APIs, no real effect on API output. (CDS-36721)</li></ul><h5>Cloud Cost Management</h5><ul><li>You
    can now create up to 1000 perspectives in Cloud Cost Management. This will help
    you:<ul><li>Create more detailed customer perspectives to slice and dice data.</li><li>Ensure
    every CCM user has access to their own perspective with cost data most relevant
    to them. (CCM-7501)</li></ul></li><li>Workload Recommendation URLs now include
    Buffer, QoS State, Cost/Performance optimized, and Timeframe. Customers can now
    share the recommendations URL with the state maintained. (CCM-6867)</li></ul><h4>Issues
    Fixed in This Release</h4><ul><li>When we update SLO it doesn&#39;t show recalculated
    value. (SRM-10266)</li><li>YAML order of metric threshold for verify step is fixed.
    Before the fix It was inconsistent in some cases. (RM-10249, ZD-29515)</li><li>Verification

    description (on hover).</li><li>Edit variable window should have title - Edit
    Variable.</li><li>Renamed Variable to Variables in Access control page. (PL-25122)</li></ul></li><li>Due
    to preference framework, gitSyncAPI started using Org/Project from saved preferences.
    Due to this, gitFilters were visible on account-level page as well, which was
    not the intended behavior. Re-instated the gitSync API to use Org/Project from
    path only. (PL-25102)</li><li>Access to &#34;USER&#34; scope is not available
    in the current context. (PL-25097)</li><li>Script to tag JIRAs was misspelled
    and hence not found when tried to be executed. The script-name spelling is fixed
    now. (PL-25071)</li><li>In SCIM group identifier, names &#39;.&#39; will be replaced
    by &#39;_&#39;. (PL-24987, ZD-30279)</li><li>Now, read-only HashiCorp Secret Manager
    cannot be set as default secrets manager (PL-24810)</li><li>From now on if we
    delete an org, all the connectors in that org scope gets deleted. (PL-24786)</li><li>Previously,
    a red error message appeared at the top of the screen with the message: Account

    after this change. (PL-23956)</li><li>We have fixed a bug where View Permission
    link for Secret Managers in NG wasn&#39;t taking to NG Docs. Steps to verify:<ul><li>Create
    AWS KMS SM ( any other SM).</li><li>Enter wrong credentials.</li><li>Test Connection
    screen should have view permission link.</li><li>Click on view permission --&gt;
    Should take you to specified link in NG Docs. (PL-22352)</li></ul></li><li>Filter

    list height based on remaining spaces. (PIE-3488, ZD-29720)</li><li>Added a min
    width of 1100px for the pipeline studio page. (PIE-3108)</li><li>If there are
    multiple stages, and if a stage failed with a rollback failure strategy that executes
    rollback steps, but after it the next stages will continue. The next stages will
    execute or get skipped based on their when condition, which was not working earlier
    only if previous Stage failed with rollback failure strategy. (PIE-2338, ZD-30753)</li><li>Cosmetic
    change for skipped stages - background color of node. (PIE-2172)</li><li>You can
    now see your Target name in bold before confirming it to be deleted. (FFM-3221)</li><li>Fixed

    (DEL-4048, ZD-30610, ZD-30637, ZD-30772)</li><li>Introduced caching for ng secrets
    in manager, which will allow us to re-use cached secrets which are being used
    frequently. Hence will reduce the manager&#39;s processing time. (DEL-3957, ZD-30225)</li><li>Configure
    correct paths to built-in client tools that are being used by Delegate. (DEL-3784,
    ZD-29697, ZD-29727)</li><li>Delegate resource will appear in multi-select filter
    and module column missing icons for type Delegate in Audit Trail data table. (DEL-3754)</li><li>Alignment

    API logic to calculate Delegate connections. (DEL-3200)</li><li>Now you can create
    Parallel Stage Pipeline templates. Also some miscellaneous bugs were fixed. (CI-4436)</li><li>Before
    this fix, the active committer count for enterprise users counts one user who
    worked on different projects multiple times, now it does not. (CI-4413)</li><li>Pipeline
    with Codebase Connector as a runtime input was showing loading ... when user selects
    connector on Run Pipeline form. Now it is fixed. (CI-4408)</li><li>CI Build is
    not triggering when opening a PR. Logs added as an intermittent fix. (CI-4405)</li><li>Fix
    CI and Orchestration component tests failed in master. (CI-4357)</li><li>Added
    validation on backend to fix the case where build is empty string. (CI-4352)</li><li>Trim

    to see a dropdown with allowed values specified for a field set as runtime input
    and select a value from the dropdown. (CI-4273)</li><li>Fixed the immediate issue
    along with automation addition. (CI-4258)</li><li>Assign automount Service Token
    to true when the user selects Kubernetes as the Infrastructure Type. (CI-4056)</li><li>The
    UI now fetches updated summary when the user clicks on different nodes. It also

    a new attribute pool_name to replace identifier, which is deprecated with this
    change. (CI-3416)</li><li>Issue: After last deployment, validation for variables
    having yes/no as allowed values started to fail saying value doesn&#39;t exist
    in the allowed values list. This started happening because yes/no was being treated
    as boolean rather than string (as per yaml specification: https://yaml.org/type/bool.html),
    hence converting these to true/false and failing the allowed values validation.</li><li>This
    was fixed after treating all the input values as String. (CDS-37478, ZD-30730)</li><li>Timeout
    for Azure connector connection check around 10 minutes. (CDS-37260)</li><li>Propagate

    a fix to honor Git repo and branch while selecting a Pipeline template in Pipeline
    Studio. (CDS-36960)</li><li>Under Infra tab, Google Kubernetes Engine should be
    selected upon clicking on that tile. Fixed by using already selected infra as
    initial values when component gets rendered (CDS-36887)</li><li>On new artifact
    and manifest triggers not working for a Pipeline created from template. Added
    a fix for artifacts and manifests trigger to work with Pipeline using templates.
    (CDS-36813)</li><li>Fixed issue where the &#34;Invalid Feature&#34; banner appears
    on CD pages. (CDS-36797)</li><li>Docker Tags will now be listed for Account level
    and Org level templates. (CDS-36650)</li><li>&#34;Failed to Fetch&#34; is displayed
    in the Template page when user does not have permission for the Org/Project. Added
    relevant error message. CDS-36540</li><li>Number of failures is off. Temporarily
    hiding the failure counts. CDS-36451</li><li>Tooltip when manually entering an
    Artifact doesn&#39;t show anything. Manually enter experience not clear for tags.
    (CDS-36079)</li><li>NG Harness Approvals - UI issues with User group field as
    expression. Revising the user input to remove empty strings. (CDS-35995)</li><li>Service
    Dashboard needs to contain artifact details. Environment Deployment widget will
    includes the custom artifacts as well. (CDS-35582)</li><li>Delegate throwing too
    many redirects when running the http command. (CDS-34768)</li><li>On groupBy businessMapping,
    we are not getting the correct data because we are storing accountNames along
    with accountIds while saving business mapping. We removed the accountNames while
    saving and appended accountNames in case of get/list request. (CCM-7518)</li></ul><h3>May
    11, 202, minor release 74969</h3><h4>New Features and Enhancements</h4><p>The
    following new features are added to the Harness Self-Managed Enterprise Edition
    components:</p><ul><li>Detailed YAML Snippets for User Group audits have been
    added with this release. (PL-23573)</li><li>You can now update users&#39; details
    using service tokens. This enables you to update the details of a specific user
    in the Account using a Service API Key that has manage user permissions for that
    user. (PL-23163)<ul><li>See <a href="https://harness.io/docs/api/tag/User/#operation/unlockUser"
    target="_blank">Unlock User in a Given Scope</a>.</li></ul></li><li>There is now
    validation for feature flag toggling. If you don&#39;t have an existing environment,
    you will now see an error message appearing as a tooltip informing you that you
    are unable to toggle your feature flag(s). The toggle will be disabled until an
    environment is created. (FFM-2470)</li><li>Delegate tokens are used by Harness
    to encrypt communication between Harness Delegates and the Harness Manager. By
    default, when a new Harness account is created, all Harness Delegates in that
    account include the same token. You can now use APIKeys for Delegate NG Token
    management.<br/> See the <a href="https://harness.io/docs/api/tag/Delegate-Token-Resource"
    target="_blank">Delegate Token Resource API</a> docs. (DEL-3609)</li><li>You can
    now view events associated with Delegates on the Audit Trail page. With Audit
    Trail in Harness, you can view and track changes made to your Harness resources
    within your Harness account. Audit events are registered for Delegate creation,
    Delegate deletion, and Delegate group deletion. No event is registered for Delegate
    update. For each event record, this view shows the following: (DEL-3377)<ul><li>Date
    and time (<strong>Time</strong>).</li><li>The user who made the change (<strong>User</strong>).</li><li><strong>Action</strong> by
    the user like create, update, delete.</li><li>Harness entity affected (<strong>Resource</strong>).</li><li><strong>Organization</strong> corresponding
    to the affected entity.</li><li><strong>Project</strong> corresponding to the
    affected entity.</li><li><strong>Module</strong> corresponding to the affected
    entity.</li><li><strong>Event Summary</strong> with YAML difference.</li></ul><figure><img

    <a href="https://ngdocs.harness.io/article/r5ytrnpcgr">View Audit Trail</a>.</li></ul></li><li><code>OrgIdentifier</code>
    and <code>ProjectIdentifier</code> have been removed from Delegate YAML. Also,
    it is now mandatory to pass the Delegate token name while downloading an NG Delegate
    YAML. The token used by the Delegate will be used to extract the correct <code>OrgIdentifier</code>
    and <code>ProjectIdentifier</code>. (DEL-3184)</li><li>You can provide <code>JAVA
    OPTS</code> for Delegates to override Java properties for things like setting
    up key stores for TLS verification. This option was previously available for both
    Delegate and Watcher. We are breaking the variable for Delegate and Watcher with
    this release. The current <code>JAVA OPTS</code> variable will continue to function,
    but if you want to set it up for Watcher, you must provide <code>WATCHER JAVA
    OPTS</code> as an environment variable. This has advantages such as monitoring
    the Watcher and Delegate separately with APM agents. (DEL-3040)</li><li>The Get
    GCP Clusters API is hidden by the Open API Specification. (CDS-35459)</li><li>You
    can now use Custom Artifact with a fixed value in your deployments. This will
    help you to:<ul><li>Use custom value for artifact version and reference in your
    steps using &lt;+artifact.version&gt; or <code>&lt;artifacts.sidecars.id.version&gt;</code>
    and allow to track what version has been deployed</li><li>Pass any artifact version
    from your CI stage to CD stage without the need to rely on existing or supported
    artifact server.<br/>This feature is available behind the Feature Flag <code>CUSTOM_ARTIFACT_NG</code>.
    (CDS-35216)</li></ul></li><li>You can now use a GCP Connector when selecting Infrastructure
    for Kubernetes deployments. You will be able to use the GKE Workload identity
    when inheriting credentials from a Delegate. (CDS-7363)<ul><li>See <a href="https://ngdocs.harness.io/article/u29v1uc1mh">Kubernetes
    Deployments Overview</a>.</li></ul></li><li>You can now filter and Group By Perspectives
    based on the <strong>Cluster Type</strong>. Perspectives allow you to group your

    (CCM-7317)</li></ul><h3>March 30, 2022, minor release 74410</h3><h4>New Features
    and Enhancements</h4><p>The following new features were added to the Harness platform
    components:</p><h5>SRM</h5><ul><li>Service Reliability Management is now available
    on on-premise platforms. (SRM-9858)</li></ul><h5>Platform</h5><ul><li>Added a
    new Auth mechanism called Kubernetes Auth that takes serviceAccountTokenPath and
    role (PL-23491)</li><li>The default selection of Resource Group has been changed
    to All Resources Including Child scopes from All Resources at a particular scope.
    This means you can select all resources by default and only limit and create custom
    resource groups based on your use cases. This will not impact any existing role
    bindings. (PL-23255)</li><li>You can now create, remove, update, and delete entities
    for a Git Sync-enabled project using the API key. This will help you automate
    the onboarding on a project using harness APIs. (PL-22170)</li><li>The Account
    Overview page has a new <strong>Disable default Harness Account Manager</strong>
    setting. If this option is enabled, cannot use this Secret Manager for creating
    any new secrets. (PL-22001)</li><li>You can now use Hashicorp Vault Connector
    in NextGen using the AWS IAM authentication method. This method provides an automated
    mechanism to retrieve a Vault token for IAM principals and AWS EC2 instances.<br/>There
    are two authentication types present in the aws auth method: <code>iam</code>
    and <code>ec2</code>.<br/>The <code>iam</code> method is the recommended approach
    and we are supporting the same. See <a href="https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/aws#iam-auth-method"
    target="_blank">https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/aws#iam-auth-method</a>.<br/>The
    official Vault document describes the infrastructure required: <a href="https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/aws#authentication">https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/aws#authentication</a><br/>This
    will impact users who will enable this new method of authentication for Hashicorp
    Vault in NextGen. (PL-21921)</li><li>Harness NG Pipelines now will limit the maximum
    number of parallel stages to 30. If you require more than 30 stages to run in
    parallel, please reach out to Harness Customer Success to enable the Feature Flag.
    Note that this does not limit the number of stages you can add to the pipeline.
    Limit applicable only for parallel stages. (PIE-2723)</li><li>We now have APIs
    to validate an existing pipeline without saving. Users can also validate a YAML.<ul><li><a
    href="https://harness.io/docs/api/tag/Pipelines#operation/postPipeline_1" target="_blank">pipelines/validate-yaml-with-schema</a>:
    This API takes a pipeline YAML in Body and validates against the YAML Schema.</li><li><a
    href="https://harness.io/docs/api/tag/Pipelines#operation/postPipeline_2" target="_blank">pipelines/validate-pipeline-with-schema</a>:
    This API takes pipeline identifier as a query parameter and validates that pipeline
    against YAML Schema. (PIE-2632)</li></ul></li><li>NG now supports these new Expressions:<ul><li><code>&lt;+pipeline.triggerType&gt;</code>
    - Gives you the type of Trigger such as Manual or Webhook.</li><li><code>&lt;+pipeline.triggeredBy.name&gt;</code>
    - Gives the name of the user, returns trigger name in case of Webhook.</li><li><code>&lt;+pipeline.triggeredBy.email&gt;</code>
    - Gives the email of the user, returns NULL in case of Webhook. (PIE-2527)</li></ul></li></ul><h5>CI</h5><ul><li>You
    can now view your test reports in an aggregated way by selecting all stages and
    all steps. This will help you understand the bigger picture of your test reports,
    especially if you are running across multiple stages. (CI-3603)</li></ul><h5>CDS</h5><ul><li>Customers
    can now add and use Docker images from Nexus and Artifactory registries in the
    Artifacts section of a Pipeline (NG). This is available for for Kubernetes and
    Native Helm deployments only.<br/>To use this option, make sure that your manifest
    files contain specific Harness expressions as described in <a href="https://ngdocs.harness.io/article/4ifq51cp0i-add-artifacts-for-kubernetes-deployments"
    target="_blank">Add Container Images as Artifacts for Kubernetes Deployments</a>.
    (CDS-7728)</li></ul><h5>CCM</h5><ul><li>Cost Perspective URLs now include TimeRange,
    GroupBy, Filters, Aggregation, and Chart Type. Perspective URLs are now shareable
    as in Current Gen. When shared, a Cost Perspective will take users to the same
    state (same Filters, ChartBy, etc.) as the user who shared the URL. (CCM-5431)</li></ul><h4>Issues
    Fixed in the Release</h4><ul><li>Migration fix (SRM-9515)</li><li>Fixed Datadog
    data collection bug when some configured metrics where not visible in the result

    name. (PL-23673)</li><li>We are now retaining previous step values in the Enable
    Git Experience Popup. (PL-23651)</li><li>Fixed issue in Git Sync: Wrong branch
    shown in a repo in Pipeline Run &gt; save Input Set (PL-23626)</li><li>SCIM users
    can now be provisioned in NG even if they exist in CG. There needs to be two separate
    SCIM apps to be used for both CG/NG to be working together. (PL-23160, ZD-271,
    ZD-172, ZD-791, ZD-028, ZD-668)</li><li>You can now configure a logout URL in
    SAML Settings from the UI itself. We have added an extra field for logout URL
    in SAML Settings both in NG and CG. Hence you can configure and see the logout
    URL while configuring SAML Settings user . (PL-23106)</li><li>Fixed a bug where
    a left purple border was visible across all modals on NG-UI. (PL-23087)</li><li>Fixed
    a bug where a global styling change adversely impacted the widths of some modal
    dialog boxes. Reverted the previous global styling change and fixed it across
    specific modals in the NG UI. (PL-23065)</li><li>Fixed a bug where a global styling
    change had adverse impact on widths of some modals (PL-23050)</li><li>Enabling
    ng-auth-ui in on-prem builds is now behind a environment variable. (PL-22728)</li><li>Fixed
    a UI bug where some fields seemed to be extending out of the modal. (PL-22559)</li><li>Values
    are not retaining if a user clicks on the previous step. (PL-22418)</li><li>The
    Git Sync feature was not working for accounts that use the vanity URL. We have
    fixed this issue in the current release. This will help you:<ul><li>Automatically
    register the Git Sync webhook URL.</li><li>Perform the YAML changes from Git.
    (PL-22260, ZD-26717)</li></ul></li><li>Popup message shown as soon as user arrives
    on &#34;branch to sync&#34; step while enabling Git Sync. (PL-22191)</li><li>Response
    message not clear if Organization is missing in request. (PL-21765)</li><li>Added
    a tooltip over a fixed input so that if a user choses a custom tag longer than
    the input width, it&#39;s still fully visible and selectable. (PL-21624)</li><li>Terraform
    pipeline 400 response when retrieving artifact data with Account Connector. (PIE-3072)</li><li>Added
    placeholders for all Execution step types. (PIE-3048)</li><li>Services overview
    shows &#34;Unknown&#34; as status for Pipeline executions where the status was
    Rejected or Waiting. (PIE-2909)</li><li>Showing Pipeline stages based on module
    existence, instead of status ACTIVE check. (PIE-2851)</li><li>Values in drop-down
    dialog box are hidden. (PIE-2699)</li><li>Zoom to Fit in Pipeline execution does
    not persist. (PIE-2561)</li><li>Use <strong>ID</strong> instead of <strong>Id</strong>
    in user visible strings such as UI tool tips. (PIE-2241)</li><li>Multi-button
    CSS changed for text area component. (PIE-1661)</li><li>&#34;Page Not Found&#34;
    appears immediately after user clicks Edit for a Trigger in a Git Sync-enabled
    project. (CI-3697)</li><li>Disable the Trigger tab or create/edit a new Trigger
    when the user is not on the default branch of the repository in a Git Sync-enabled
    project. (CI-3475, ZD-26590)</li><li>Annotations do not appear in Run Pipeline
    form if even one child field in it is a runtime input. (CI-3393)</li><li>NG: Stage
    template saved as stage step after adding/deleting stage variable. (CDS-35000,
    ZD-284, ZD-642, ZD-851, ZD-728, ZD-758)</li><li>With this fix, if a values.yaml
    or a Kustomize patch references a non-existent expression, the workflow fails
    on the Fetch File step with an error message that the expression does not exist.
    (CDS-34981, ZD-26598)</li><li>&#34;Stage&#34; should be uppercase in the UI. (CDS-34953)</li><li>Users
    can now easily create and manage all the variables used in the stage templates
    with the variables panel in the template studio. (CDS-34045)</li><li>You can now
    see the exact error when the Connector cannot fetch the Jira projects. (CDS-25448)</li></ul><h4>Delegate

    with Helm:</strong> Harness Kubernetes deployments allow you to use your own Helm
    values.yaml or Helm chart (remote or local), and Harness executes the Kubernetes
    kubectl calls to build everything without Helm and Tiller needing to be installed
    in the target cluster. You can perform all deployment strategies (Rolling, Canary,
    Blue Green).<br/>See <a href="https://ngdocs.harness.io/article/knunou9j30-kubernetes-cd-quickstart">Kubernetes

    Chart CD Quickstart</a>.</li><li><strong>Native Helm:</strong> For Harness Native Helm
    deployments, you must always have Helm and Tiller running on one pod in your target
    cluster and Tiller makes the API calls to Kubernetes. You can perform a Rolling
    deployment strategy only.</li><li>See <a href="/article/lbhf2h71at-native-helm-quickstart">Native
