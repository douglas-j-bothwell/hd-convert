  description: Harness Cloud Cost Management SaaS Release Notes
  short_version: Harness Cloud Cost Management SaaS Release Notes
  body: '<p></p><p>Harness Cloud Cost Management is updated regularly. Review the
    notes below for details about recent changes.</p><p>For information about releases
    prior to July 2022, refer to <a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/7zkchy5lhj-harness-saa-s-release-notes-2022">Harness
    SaaS Release Notes</a>.</p><div class="note-callout">If you don&#39;t see a new
    feature or enhancement in your Harness account, it might be behind a feature flag.
    Contact <a href="mailto:support@harness.io">Harness Support</a> to enable the
    feature.</div><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>September 7th, 2022, version 76619</h3><h4>Fixed
    issues</h4><ul><li>Round off Anomaly Slack Alerts to 2 Decimal Places (CCM-8769)</li><li>Refresh
    recommendation resources and instance details (CCM-8720)</li></ul><h3>August 31st,
    2022, version 76518</h3><h4>Enhancements</h4><ul><li>Azure Connector Validations
    (CCM-7650)<br/>As part of Azure Connector validations for Inventory and AutoStopping,
    we&#39;re now checking whether the service principal has the required roles for
    these features: Reader role for Inventory and Contributor role for AutoStopping.
    These checks will run whenever `Test Connector` APIs are hit for CeAzure connectors.<br/>See
    <a href="/article/v682mz6qfd-set-up-cost-visibility-for-azure">Set Up Cloud Cost
    Management for Azure</a>.</li></ul><h4>Fixed issues</h4><ul><li>Getting exceptions
    while fetching filter values for GCP and AWS (CCM-8738, ZD-33142, ZD-33948)<br/>In
    Perspective preview section, now we are checking both `ruleFilters` and `idFilters`
    to deduce whether it&#39;s a cluster perspective or not and based on the querying
    the correct table (`clusterDataAggregated` or `unifiedTable`).</li><li>API Docs
    are incorrect (CCM-8336, ZD-31845)<br/>Return the list of Recommendations API
    doc updated.</li></ul><p></p><h3>August 25th, 2022, version 76425</h3><h4>Fixed
    issues</h4><ul><li>Perspective recommendation filter is incorrect (CCM-8632)<br/>When
    you click on recommendations shown in Perspective page, you will now see only
    the list of recommendations filtered for the Perspective that you are reviewing
    instead of listing the full list of recommendations unfiltered.</li><li>Account
    name updates in AWS don&#39;t cascade to CCM DB (CCM-8598)<br/>We were not updating
    the account name in daily sync. Now updating account name in daily sync.</li><li>Cluster
    Costs missing for since 5th August (CCM-8535, ZD-33355)<br/>Now we are checking
    AWS Cluster data in `billing_table` for last 3 days and if data does not exist,
    we will run `INSTANCE_BILLING` batchJob. So we are no longer dependent on AWS
    cluster data to run batchJob.</li></ul><h3>August 18th, 2022, version 76321</h3><h4>What&#39;s
    new</h4><ul><li>Cluster Perspective - Total Cost, Table values UX improvement
    (CCM-7968, ZD-31764)</li><li>Difficulty &#34;Grouping By&#34; Cost Category within
    Perspectives (CCM-7784)<br/>You can now search Cost Categories in your chart.<figure><img
    src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/articles/0vb3ptuhgq/1662143781817/image.png"/></figure></li><li>List
    BI Dashboards API (CCM-7649)<br/>You can now query a new API to list all the BI
    Dashboards specific to CCM: <a href="https://harness.io/docs/api/tag/Cloud-Cost-BI-Dashboards#operation/listBIDashboards">Cloud
    Cost BI Dashboards</a>.<br/>Example query:<pre>curl -i -X GET \<br/>  &#39;https://app.harness.io/gateway/ccm/api/bi-dashboards?accountIdentifier=H5W8ioxxxA2MXg&#39;
    \<br/>  -H &#39;x-api-key: pat.H5xxxA2MXg.6xxxmD&#39;</pre><br/>Example response:<pre>{<br/>  &#34;status&#34;:

    issues</h4><ul><li>Fix labels null value (CCM-8558)<br/>When we were sending <code>label.key
    IN [&#34;&#34;]</code> -&gt; Empty Array, BE is setting the empty array to null.
    Now to handle it, we have added a null check while converting conditions values
    to filter values.</li><li>CCM Perspectives seem to be broken in new UI (CCM-8484,
    ZD-33142)<br/>In the Perspective Preview section, we were not considering whether
    it’s a cluster perspective or not. Therefore, we always query unifiedtable. This
    issue has been resolved. Now, in Perspective Preview section, we are checking
    whether it’s a cluster perspective or not and based on that querying the correct
    table.</li><li>Azure Existing connector validation is failing at test connection
    (CCM-8423)<br/>Something was changed in the base image for Docker files. Azcopy
    utility needs access to create .azcopy folder to keep job plan log files. It was
    not able to do so. Fix is to give explicit path for it in which it has access.</li></ul><p></p><h3>August
    8th, 2022, version 76128</h3><h4>Fixed issues</h4><ul><li>RDS Instance data in
    Dashboards doesn&#39;t reflect changes in InstanceClass (CCM-8411, ZD-32945, ZD-32995)<br/>The
    RDS inventory dashboards did not reflect the updated DBInstanceClass when RDS
    instance class was updated. Due to a bug in our RDS data-load CloudFunction, the
    DBInstanceClass column was not being updated in the awsRdsInventory table. The
    dashboards query this awsRdsInventory table, which is why the updated DBInstanceClass
    couldn&#39;t be seen in the dashboard. The issue has been resolved. The RDS Inventory
    dashboard now displays the updated instance-class as expected. Also, there was
    discrepancy in data due to a bug in join condition of our looker query. We have
    updated the join and the data looks correct now.</li><li>Azure Connectors are
    failing (CCM-8298, ZD-32605, ZD-32612)<br/>We had a regression in the data pipeline.
    Fix is deployed.</li></ul><p></p><h3>August 1, 2022, version 76030</h3><h4>What&#39;s
    new</h4><ul><li>CCM Perspective Preferences.<ul><li>When you create a CCM Perspective
    you can now set Preferences for <strong>Include Others</strong> and <strong>Unallocated
    Costs</strong>.</li><li>For details, go to <strong>Perspective Preferences</strong>
    in <a href="/article/dvspc6ub0v-create-cost-perspectives">Create Cost Perspectives</a>.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Early
    access</h4><ul><li>N/A</li></ul><h4>Enhancements</h4><ul><li>Perspective Preferences:
    Unallocated and Include Others cost support added (CCM-7436)<ul><li>Now while
    creating a perspective, you will see one a Preferences tab to select the preferences
    for a particular Perspective. And on the Perspective page, you can toggle the
    preferences options to see their cost in Perspective chart section.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Fixed
    issues</h4><ul><li>CCM missing data for our production cluster (CCM-8214, ZD-32384)<ul><li>Usually
    the node resource values from instanceType are displayed in the format custom-8-24576,
    but for the format was different and looked like n2d-custom-8-220160-ext.</li></ul></li><li>Cost
    Category-based perspective does not showcase cost breakdown (CCM-8068)<ul><li>During
    Perspective save, Cost Category was not identified as a separate data source and
    the grid API call was failing. Added Cost Category in data sources if Cost Category
    rules are present in Perspective.</li></ul></li><li>Not including Others and Unallocated
    cost in perspectiveTimeSeriesStats (CCM-7973)<ul><li>You can include Others and
    Unallocated Cost for a Perspective Time Series Chart.</li></ul></li><li>CCM dashboards
    database errors (CCM-7791)<ul><li>Converting queries to Batch queries. Removing
    certain Alter statements as they are no longer required.</li></ul></li></ul><p></p><h3>July

    issues</h4><ul><li>AWS CCM Connector failing after previous successful connections
    (CCM-8143)<ul><li>A function was running out of memory because of a large volume
    of inventory data and was not able to execute fully. We have increased the memory
    for that function for now and the EC2 data is now being ingested.</li></ul></li><li>Some
    ECS clusters do not show Tasks/Services (CCM-8126)<ul><li>The instance type filters
    were incorrect when grouping by task/service. Fixed the instance type filter.</li></ul></li><li>Some
    Dashboards not working (CCM-8124, ZD-32035)<ul><li>Fixed the merge query in load
    cloudfunction for AWS RDS.</li></ul></li><li>CCM GCP connector showing no error
    when testing connection (CCM-8076)<ul><li>Make use of gcpConnectorInfo table for
    non-US regions and correct the error messages for framework to render them.</li></ul></li><li>Azure
    perspective GCP Anomalies (CCM-7882)<ul><li>Azure perspective rules were not imposed
