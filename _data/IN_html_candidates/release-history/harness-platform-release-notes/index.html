Contact <a href="mailto:support@harness.io">Harness Support</a> to enable the feature.</div><h3>September 7th, 2022, version 76619</h3><h4>What&#39;s new</h4><ul><li>You can now inherit User Groups created at a higher scope by using <strong>Assign Roles. </strong>(PL-27237)<figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/articles/8c1rry91s1/1662609334005/screenshot-2022-06-06-at-12-01-40-pm.png" style="max-height:50%;max-width:50%" data-hd-height="50%" data-hd-width="50%"/></figure>See <a href="/article/dfwuvmy33m-add-user-groups#step_assign_roles">Assign Roles</a>.</li><li>You can now view the past 10 executions of the Pipelines and sort them from the table. You can also go to a specific execution by clicking on it. (PIE-4903)</li></ul><h4>Early access</h4><ul><li>You can now create a Harness Custom Secret Manager in Next Gen. (PL-25545)<br/>You can onboard any secret manager with Harness and reference their secrets in Harness using a Shell Script.<br/>This is behind the feature flag CUSTOM_SECRET_MANAGER_NG.<br/>See <a href="/article/mg09uspsx1-custom-secret-manager">Add a Custom Secret Manager</a>.</li></ul><h4>Fixed issues</h4><ul><li>The <strong>Description</strong> of User Groups in Access Control was not wrapped and was resulting in inconsistent UI. (PL-27733, ZD-34043)</li><li>Error was thrown when importing a Pipeline from Git which was already in use. (PL-27598)<br/>This is fixed now by displaying a confirmation message.</li><li>Pipeline was not being triggered while setting up a trigger for a Bitbucket repo. (PIE-4827, ZD-33190)<br/>This is fixed by fixing the order of commit hashes being passed from delegate to SCM service.</li></ul><h3>August 31st, 2022, version 76515</h3><h4>What&#39;s new</h4><ul><li>Git Experience in Next Gen is now enhanced and simplified. (PL-26339)<br/>See <a href="/article/xl028jo9jk-git-experience-overview">Git Experience</a>.</li><li>You can now switch branches directly from the Pipeline execution history.

(PIE-5008)<br/>The Add Stage and Add Step options are now hidden for users with <strong>View</strong> permission.</li><li>The existing Input Sets were not getting updated.
