By upgrading the version of the library, we now have support to customize this behavior. Now we have defined how a number will be deserialized.<br/>This issue is now resolved.</li><li>Fix the text wrapping in Health Sources table in Verify step (SRM-11185)</li></ul><h3>August 8th, 2022, version 76128</h3><h4>Fixed issues</h4><ul><li>Fetching Audits and JSON DTO Issues in Audit List API (SRM-11140)<br/>Sequence in which services are deleted when project is deleted was incorrect. Now while deleting the project we can see both Monitored service and SLO audits.</li><li>Monitored Service with New Relic health source displays error message “same identifier is used by multiple entities” even though there is no other health source with same Id (SRM-10999)</li></ul><p></p><h3>August 1, 2022, version 76030</h3><h4>Fixed issues</h4><ul><li>Verification is not happening correctly when we configure Monitored Service using templates (SRM-11097)<ul><li>Verify step for Template type Monitored Service was not working due to a missing record in the database. For such use cases, we use a transient entity. Updated to code to support both transient and persisted entities.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>July 18th, 2022, version 75921</h3><h4>Fixed issues</h4><ul><li>Data Collection for CustomLogs is failing in Verification step (SRM-11003)<ul><li>The Custom Log Health Source feature was unable to collect and process the data in the Verify step. This feature uses different DSL scripts to collect log data and service instance (host) data. If the log data collection DSL can also provide the host data, we do not need the host data DSL explicitly. However, in this case, the log collection DSL was also being used to collect the host data, which led to a Type mismatch error during the data processing. By removing the use of log collection DSL as the host collection DSL, we are able to pull the host data from the log data itself and it also ceases the exception. This feature is now working correctly.</li></ul></li><li>Creation of Custom Health Source Metrics for Service based is failing (SRM-11002)<ul><li>The Custom Metric Source Health did not work if the data query type was of type Service. The issue was happening due to a validation on the field metricPath in the Json response mapping, which is not present for the given query type. The given field is now optional. This issue has been resolved.</li></ul></li><li>GCP Metric Verify Step: Seeing null pointer exception in execution logs for GCP metric Health Source (SRM-10674)<ul><li>Fixed a null pointer exception in data collection for verify step.</li></ul></li><li>SLO: Not able to create an SLO with GCP as metrics (SRM-10594)<ul><li>Adding better logging.</li></ul></li></ul><p></p><h3>July 11th, 2022, version 75829</h3><h4>Fixed issues</h4><ul><li>Continuous Verification not appearing in Deployment Stage template (SRM-10934)<br/>Continuous Verification step was not appearing. Continuous Verification step now appears.</li><li>Email Notification failing with invalid template message (SRM-10923)<br/>Added the message body into a string and formatted with HTML.</li><li>SLO says &#34;recalculating&#34; for over a day (SRM-10864)</li><li>Continuous Verification filter taking default monitored service for configured and template use case (SRM-10839)<br/>Implemented Continuous Verification filter logic for configured and template use case.</li><li>Custom Health Host Metric data collection not collecting data for all hosts (SRM-10831)</li><li>Prometheus Continuous Verification perpetual task failing (SRM-10829)<br/>Caused by comparability issues in decrypting data. Handling it gracefully now.<br/>Fixed compatibility issues with perpetual task.</li></ul><p></p>
