    New</h4><ul><li>N/A</li></ul><h4>Early Access</h4><ul><li>N/A</li></ul><h4>Fixed
    Issues</h4><ul><li>Added UI validation to ensure the Limit Memory and Limit CPU
    fields have the required formats. Previously, incorrect values for these fields
    were flagged during a build, which would cause the build to fail. (CI-5463)</li><li>Added
    a force-kill flag to ensure that CI pods are deleted during a build cleanup. This
    ensures that pods get cleaned up even if they are in an Unknown or Not-Ready state.
    (CI-5377)</li><li>Changed the “exit x” button that appears when creating a connector
    to make it more visible. (CI-5323)</li><li>Added a validation to ensure that a
    user provides a repo name when setting up a trigger with an account-level Git
    connector. Without this validation, the UI would allow users to click Save without
    a repo name but the trigger would not get created. (CI-5315)</li><li>Improved
    the error message that appears when a connection test fails because an account-level
    resource is trying to use a project-level secret. (CI-4705)</li><li>Fixed an issue
    in the Run Tests step that could cause a manual build to fail if a Git branch
    was not specified. (CI-4581)</li></ul><p></p>
