Previously, incorrect values for these fields were flagged during a build, which would cause the build to fail. (CI-5463)</li><li>Added a force-kill flag to ensure that CI pods are deleted during a build cleanup. This ensures that pods get cleaned up even if they are in an Unknown or Not-Ready state. (CI-5377)</li><li>Changed the “exit x” button that appears when creating a connector to make it more visible. (CI-5323)</li><li>Added a validation to ensure that a user provides a repo name when setting up a trigger with an account-level Git connector. Without this validation, the UI would allow users to click Save without a repo name but the trigger would not get created. (CI-5315)</li><li>Improved the error message that appears when a connection test fails because an account-level resource is trying to use a project-level secret. (CI-4705)</li><li>Fixed an issue in the Run Tests step that could cause a manual build to fail if a Git branch was not specified. (CI-4581)</li></ul><p></p>
