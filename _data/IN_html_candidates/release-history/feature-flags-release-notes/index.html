Fixes in this update include:</p><ul><li><strong>The package name for the SDK has changed from</strong> <strong><code>ff-netF48-server-sdk</code></strong> <strong>to</strong> <strong><code>ff-dotnet-server-sdk</code></strong><strong>. To use this version, make sure you remove the old package name and use the new one.</strong></li><li>The sample app in the .NET SDK Git repository has been updated to the new version 1.1.3. (FFM-3651)</li><li>The default configuration of the .NET SDK didn&#39;t have analytics enabled. (FFM-3520)<br/>This has been fixed and analytics is now set to <code>true</code> and enabled as default.</li><li>When using the Relay Proxy with the .NET SDK, the URL for sending events was incorrect. (FFM-3652)<br/>The events URL has now been updated so it directs to the correct place.</li><li>The .NET SDK <a href="https://github.com/harness/ff-dotnet-server-sdk/blob/main/README.md" target="_blank">README</a> file has been updated to rename the Target data. (FFM-3759)<br/>The example Target data is now consistent across the sample code in the README and the SDK Reference Guide.</li><li>The .NET SDK <a href="https://github.com/harness/ff-dotnet-server-sdk/blob/main/README.md" target="_blank">README</a> file has updated to remove an extra period and a reference to debugging that was causing the example to fail. (FFM-4306)<br/>You can now run the example successfully.</li><li>When evaluating Target Groups that used an <code>IN</code> operator, the SDK was only evaluating the first Target. (FFM-4358)<br/>The logic has now been fixed so that the SDK will check all values when an <code>IN</code> operator is used for a Target Group.</li></ul><h3>August 18, 2022</h3><h4>What&#39;s new</h4><ul><li>N/A</li></ul><h4>Early access</h4><ul><li>N/A</li></ul><h4>Fixed issues</h4><h5>Feature Flags on the Harness Platform</h5><ul><li>When creating a stage on pipeline template, Name and Description fields were displayed . (FFM-4098)<br/>As these fields are not required for creating a stage using a template, they have been removed from the <strong>About your Stage</strong> screen. You will no longer be able to enter a name and description for stages on a Pipeline template, but note this applies to templates only.</li><li>When using a Pipeline and configuring a Flag stage, only the first 15 Flags in your Project would appear as an option in the Select Flag menu. (FFM-3716)<br/>This has been fixed and you can now select any Flag in your Project.</li></ul><h5>Feature Flag SDKs</h5><ul><li>The <a href="https://github.com/harness/ff-python-server-sdk" target="_blank"><strong>Python SDK</strong></a> has been updated to Version 1.1.1. Fixes in this update include:<ul><li>Removing the type of Flag check on Prerequisite Flags. (FFM-3868)<br/>Previously, if you created a Multivariate Flag as a Prerequisite Flag, once you turned the Flag on you couldn&#39;t turn it off again. This bug has been fixed and you can now turn Flags with Multivariate Prerequisite Flags.</li></ul></li><li>The <a href="https://github.com/harness/ff-nodejs-server-sdk" target="_blank">Node.js SDK</a> has been updated to Version 1.2.7. Fixes in this update include:<ul><li>When using conditions for Target Groups, <strong>and</strong> conditions were treated as <strong>or</strong> conditions, meaning some Targets were not selected. (FFM-4331)<br/>This has now been fixed and conditions are treated correctly.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>August 8, 2022</h3><h4>What&#39;s new</h4><ul><li>N/A</li></ul><h4>Early access</h4><ul><li>N/A</li></ul><h4>Fixed issues</h4><h5>Feature Flags on the Harness Platform</h5><ul><li>On the Harness Platform, when no Environment had been added to a project, the tooltip for a Flag toggle was displaying HTML. (FFM-4094)<br/> This has been fixed to remove the raw HTML text.</li><li>On the Harness Platform, when the value of a Variation was set as a long non-breaking string, the content on the left bar of the Flag detail page overflowed into the main content of the page. (FFM-4010)<br/> This has been fixed so that the value will now wrap correctly.</li></ul><h5>Feature Flag SDKs</h5><ul><li>The <a href="https://github.com/harness/ff-golang-server-sdk/releases/tag/v0.1.2" target="_blank"><strong>Go SDK</strong></a> has been updated to Version 0.1.2. Fixes in this update include:<ul><li>The polling interval is now measured in seconds instead of minutes. (FFM-3676)<br/>This means the interval is now 60 seconds, instead of 1 minute. If you are using the default configuration, there are no actions for you. <strong>If you configured the polling interval, you need to convert the configuration from minutes to seconds</strong>. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/4c8wljx60w-feature-flag-sdks-go-application#configure_the_sdk" target="_blank">Configure the SDK in the Go SDK Reference Guide</a>.</li><li>A check has been added to ensure that when a Flag has nested Prerequisite Flags, the correct Variations are served. (FFM-4043)</li><li>You can now turn off analytics using the Go SDK. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/4c8wljx60w-feature-flag-sdks-go-application#configure_the_sdk" target="_blank">Configure the SDK in the Go SDK Reference Guide</a>.

(FFM-4056)<br/> This has been fixed and the extra symbols have been removed.</li><li>On the Harness Platform, when adding a Flag to a Target, some text boxes did not adjust to fit the full width of the table. (4055)<br/>This has now been fixed and the text boxes adjust as necessary.</li></ul><h3>July 27, 2022</h3><h4>What&#39;s new</h4><ul><li>N/A</li></ul><h4>Early access</h4><ul><li>N/A</li></ul><h4>Fixed issues</h4><ul><li>An issue where Flag Evaluations where always returning the default Variation in the Feature Flag Node.js SDK has been fixed. Previously, if the Target you sent to Evaluate against a Flag was part of a Target Group, the default Variation was always returned instead of the valid Variation for that Flag. This is now fixed and the correct Variation is returned for all Targets.<br/><strong>Due to this fix, the Feature Flag Node.js SDK has been updated to version 1.2.6.</strong></li></ul><h3>July 18, 2022</h3><h4>What&#39;s new</h4><ul><li>N/A</li></ul><h4>Early access</h4><ul><li>N/A</li></ul><h4>Fixed issues</h4><ul><li>On the Harness UI, when you deleted the Environment you were currently active in, the identifier for that Environment should have been removed from the URL but wasn&#39;t. (FFM-3984)<br/>This issue has been fixed and the Environment identifier is now removed from the URL when you delete an active Environment.</li></ul><h3>July 11, 2022</h3><h4>What&#39;s new</h4><ul><li>N/A</li></ul><h4>Early access</h4><ul><li>N/A</li></ul><h4>Fixed issues</h4><ul><li>On the Target and Target Group page UI, when there are no Flag rules added the layout is now correctly aligned and stretches to the full available height. (FFM-3931)</li><li>On the Flags page UI, when you enter a search term that returns no results, the search bar is no longer cleared and you can use the <strong>Clear Search</strong> button. (FFM-3877)</li><li>When filtering Flags and you receive more than a single page of results then reset the filter or select another filter, the page number is updated correctly. (FFM-3876)</li><li>When editing a multivariate Flag that has two Variations, the trash icon is now displayed at the end of each Variation row. (FFM-3714)</li><li>The <strong>Retry</strong> button displayed when there is an error now reloads the Flag endpoint instead of the Environment endpoint. (FFM-3713)</li><li>On the Flag details page, the <strong>Save or Cancel</strong> footer now aligns correctly with the panel. (FFM-3712)</li></ul><p></p>
