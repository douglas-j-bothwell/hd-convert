Contact <a href="mailto:support@harness.io">Harness Support</a> to enable the feature.</div><p></p><h3>September 14, 2022, version 76708</h3><h4>What&#39;s New</h4><ul><li>Shell Script Output Variables now allow the Secret type (CDS-41263, ZD-33761)<br/>You can select String or <strong>Secret</strong> for your output variable.<figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/articles/k5lu0u6i1i/1663199673813/image.png"/></figure>When you select Secret and reference the output variable later in the Pipeline, Harness will automatically sanitize the resolved secret value in the logs.<br/>Let&#39;s look at an example. First, you add the output variable as a Secret:<figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/articles/k5lu0u6i1i/1663199970459/image.png" style="max-height:50%;max-width:50%" data-hd-height="50%" data-hd-width="50%"/></figure>Next, you reference that output variable as a secret, like this:<pre>echo &#34;my secret: &#34; &lt;+steps.CreateScript.output.outputVariables.myvar&gt;</pre><br/>When you run the Pipeline, the resolved output variable expression is sanitized:<figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/articles/k5lu0u6i1i/1663199993540/image.png"/></figure>See <a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/k5lu0u6i1i-using-shell-scripts#output_variables_as_secrets">Using Shell Scripts in CD Stages</a>.</li></ul><h4>Fixed issues</h4><ul><li>Service Dashboard: On updating the Service dashboard we were not refreshing the complete page and Service last update time was not getting updated (CDS-40897) Added serviceHeader api refresh on save and update activity.</li><li>Clicking on selected file in Harness store opens on account level (CDS-42038)</li><li>Artifact path dropdown doesn&#39;t show list of artifacts in pipeline with template where artifact path is runtime param (CDS-42445) Yaml Path for templates was not handled</li><li>Even if password is invalid you can create it in YAML (CDS-42522)</li><li>Increasing error in Setup usages thread related to git-sync (CDS-42769) Seeing entitySetupUsages Redis topic being accumulated and consumers were not able to consume references as fast as it was being produced. On debugging we found that on each execution with a Service step, we were producing unnecessary setup usages which was causing Redis stream to accumulate. We have fixed this by not producing setup usages on service step execution.</li><li>Map clusters API/UI does not show linked clusters (CDS-42790, ZD-34237) This bug was due to incorrect mapping of clusters to GitOps clusters. The issue was that scoping wasn&#39;t accounted for.</li><li>While running stage added from template UI crashes (CDS-42852) Parallel stages were not handled.</li><li>Instance sync not working for Azure infra (CDS-42889)</li><li>Unable to save tags for AWS type infra (CDS-42891) AWS tags component implementation.</li></ul><p></p><h3>September 7, 2022, version 76619</h3><h4>What&#39;s new</h4><ul><li>Support for Gov Cloud for AWS Connectors in NG (CDS-42414).<br/>AWS Government Cloud is now supported.</li><li>Support JIra &#39;user assignment&#39; fields when using Jira integration (CDS-37792).<br/>Fields that manage users and issue links are now supported by Harness.</li></ul><h4>Early access</h4><p>N/A</p><h4>Enhancements</h4><p>N/A</p><h4>Issues</h4><ul><li>GitSync pipelines are shown as inline in new pipelines listing view (CDS-42643).<br/>If old gitsync is enabled, the git details are now shown in the pipeline list.</li><li>Creation Tomcat director doesn&#39;t work (CDS-42481).<br/>The mkdir command for tomcat is now working and the response from the Delegate has been improved.</li><li>Connector test succeeds but connector fails to load images (CDS-42410) (Zendesk Ticket ID 33295).<br/>Although the connector&#39;s connectivity test is successful, the Docker connector was unable to pull images, causing pipelines to fail. This issue has been fixed. For the capability check associated with a Docker registry connector, we now use endpoint &#39;/v2&#39; for validation. This endpoint is now appended to the connector URL, if it doesn&#39;t already exist.</li><li>Unable to fetch image tags - null connector even though connector was selected (CDS-42450).<br/>This issue has been fixed.<br/>With an AWS connector, when the user wanted to test the image path by toggling the tag to fixed input from runtime, a null connector message was presented. This issue has been fixed.</li><li>Failed to retrieve [null] from Google Container Registry (CDS-42344).<br/>The Tags API call will now occur if imagePath is expression. When the value of the expression changes, new tags are fetched according to the value when pipelines are run.</li><li>UI issues while creating account level pipeline template (CDS-42291).<br/>Expressions for environment and infrastructure are not supported at project level, therefore they have been removed from the project, org, and account level.</li><li>Canary Delete says failed even though it executed in the cluster (CDS-42427).<br/>This issue has been fixed.</li><li>Pipeline deploys to same instance twice (CDS-42272). This issue has been fixed.</li><li>If execute on delegate is used in Command step it throws illegal group reference error during execution (CDS-42003).<br/>This issue has been fixed.</li><li>Observing Null pointer when shell script executes on remote host and credentials are provided using Username Password (CDS-41963) (Zendesk Ticket Numbers 33642, 34370).<br/>Previously, a Null Pointer was received when executing shell script on a remote host by using Username/Password. This issue was specific to authentication type, and it has been resolved.</li><li>Service details not displayed in UI where as YAML shows them when the service environment feature flag is enabled (CDS-41374).<br/>This issue has been fixed.</li><li>CI Trigger configuration broken webpage (CDS-41322) (Zendesk Ticket ID 33057).<br/> This issue has been fixed by preventing the deletion of referenced templates.</li><li>K8s task fails to write manifest file to path (CDS-35685). For a GitHub or GitLab connector, manifest files fail with the Paths execution. This issue has been fixed. The manifests are processed correctly for K8s tasks.</li></ul><h3>August 31, 2022, version 76515</h3><h4>What&#39;s new</h4><p>N/A</p><h4>Early access</h4><p>N/A</p><h4>Enhancements</h4><p>N/A</p><h4>Issues</h4><ul><li>Null pointer exception when running pipeline (CDS-42420) (Zendesk Ticket Ids, 33839, 33986).<br/>This issue has been fixed.</li><li>Getting &#34;Delegate not available&#34; error even when there are delegates (CDS-42394).<br/>The error message received by validateHosts API was misleading. This issue has been fixed.</li><li>Template option &#34;Always use the stable version&#34; displays as &#34;-1&#34; (CDS-42299).<br/>The Template option displayed with &#39;-1&#39; instead of &#39;Always use the stable version&#39; in the Template selection drawer. This issue has been fixed.</li><li>When clicking an execution for following pipeline, js throws error (CDS-42258).<br/>The nested stepGroup data now parses recursively to render the graph.</li><li>Error &#39;org.springframework.data.mongodb.InvalidMongoDbApiUsageException&#39; (CDS-42234).<br/>This problem occurs when spring-data-mongodb:2.2.7.RELEASE library is being used. When creating a query with multiple &#39;and&#39; operators, it interprets the construct as being invalid. This issue has been fixed.</li><li>Error &#39;io.harness.exception. runtime.NoInstancesException&#39; (CDS-42233).<br/>This was not a genuine exception. The exception was being used to determine whether to delete an entity or not. This has been updated to a warning log.</li><li>Terraform Var File config doesn&#39;t let you highlight the File Path text in the Var File modal (CDS-42226).<br/>The Terraform Var File Path inputs did not allow selecting the content of the input field. Instead, the input field was dragged if you tried to select the content. You could select the content only by double clicking on it. This issue has been resolved. Now, you can select the content in the input field without causing the dragging effect.</li><li>step template fails at Stop Service step (CDS-42204).<br/>Incorrect Tomcat path was provided in the Execution Strategies view. This issue has been fixed.</li><li>Command Step - Output variables are not available to other command units and or steps (CDS-42202).<br/>This issue has been fixed.</li><li>On choosing runtime value for File/Folder Path, js throws an error (CDS-42189).<br/> A missing runtime check on the tooltip caused the error. This issue has been fixed.</li><li>NPE when looping strategy input is invalid (CDS-42175).<br/>This issue has been fixed and an error with explanation displays.</li><li>Cannot construct Google default token source: could not find default credentials (CDS-42134).<br/>This issue has been fixed.</li><li>Handle parallel stages (CDS-42133) (Zendesk Ticket ID 33839).<br/>Handling parallel and series stage combination for EXPORT_TF_PLAN_JSON_NG has been fixed.</li><li>Jenkins Integration Not working in Account templates (CDS-42128) (Zendesk Ticket ID 33782).<br/>OrgIdentifier and ProjectIdentifier were required fields in the API. In Account template, project and organization identifier were not provided in the API, thereby causing a validation error. The validation was removed and the issue has been fixed.</li><li>Service override bugs (CDS-42112).<br/>This issue has been fixed.</li><li>Shell script: on Edit of shell script step from &#39;execute on target host&#34; to &#39;on delegate&#39; option we should remove the execution Target data from yaml (CDS-41988).<br/>The yaml should be visible when On delegate is selected and executionTarget field should not be present. This issue has been fixed.</li><li>Logs for script command units are not appearing if executed on delegate (CDS-41824).<br/>This issue has been fixed.</li><li>Support IN and NOT IN options for approval and rejection criteria for SNOW and JIRA steps all the time (CDS-41742).<br/>This issue has been fixed.</li><li>First letter in artifact name is truncated when shown in list (CDS-41491).<br/>The artifact directory was not handled correctly when a period (.) was specified. The period (.) will not be processed correctly.</li><li>Pipeline dashboard - When pipeline is aborted then we are showing it failed in the execution graph (CDS-41000).<br/>The count for aborted and expired executions has been added to the pipeline execution. This issue has been fixed.</li><li>Git sync disabled (CDS-40870).<br/>The tests were updated.</li><li>Jenkins job parameters can&#39;t be runtime inputs (CDS-40643).<br/>The Jenkins job parameters are now being accepted during runtime.</li><li>Service dashboard: Primary artifact details are not showing up under Active Service Instances section.

This issue has been fixed.</li></ul><h3>August 25, 2022, version 76425</h3><h4>What&#39;s new</h4><p>N/A</p><h4>Early access</h4><p>N/A</p><h4>Enhancements</h4><ul><li>Serverless Expression Change for Sidecars (CDS-40812). For information on serverless, see <a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/5fnx4hgwsa-serverless-lambda-cd-quickstart">Serverless Tutorial</a>.<br/>You can select multiple artifacts for serverless. Previously, you could only select a single artifact for a sidecar.</li><li>help panels according to module (CDS-41725).<br/>The CD module has new help panels that provide tailored information that is relevant for the tasks being performed in each screen or dialog.</li></ul><h4>Fixed issues</h4><ul><li>Add license check in template (CDS-42059).<br/>A license check is performed and a message is displayed to show the option to enroll in the enterprise plan when there is a choice to create a pipeline from a template, add a step template, or access a side menu with templates.</li><li>Skipped step not clickable (CDS-41920).<br/>When a step is skipped, it was not clickable.

This issue has been fixed.</li><li>Handle traffic shift for basic deployment (CDS-41760).<br/>Basic deployments are not handled for traffic shift anymore. This issue has been fixed.</li><li>Can&#39;t Pull Service Usage Data.
