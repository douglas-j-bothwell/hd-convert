  body: '<p>Learn about the new early access features in all Harness modules. Early
    access features require a feature flag.</p><h3>September 7th, 2022</h3><h4>Harness
    Platform</h4><p>You can now create a Harness Custom Secret Manager in Next Gen.
    (PL-25545)</p><p>You can onboard any secret manager with Harness and reference
    their secrets in Harness using a Shell Script.</p><p>This is behind the feature
    flag CUSTOM_SECRET_MANAGER_NG.</p><p>See <a href="/article/mg09uspsx1-custom-secret-manager">Add
    a Custom Secret Manager</a>.</p><h3>July 7th, 2022</h3><h4>Harness Platform</h4><p><strong>Reuse
    of identifiers after deletion</strong></p><p>Customers will now be able to reuse
    identifiers of deleted entities. Previously, we took the approach to soft-delete
    entities, which prevented users from reusing identifiers after deletion. Now we
    hard-delete entities, which allows customers to reuse identifiers after deletion.</p><p>However,
    caution must be exercised while reusing identifiers as any history of the deleted
    entity in audit logs now maps to the new entity using the same identifier.</p><p>This
    functionality is behind a feature flag: HARDDELETEENTITIES</p><h3>June 16, 2022</h3><h4>Harness
    Platform</h4><p><strong>Simplified Git Experience</strong></p><p>Harness Git Experience
    lets you store configurations for your resources like Pipelines, Input Sets in
    Git. You can choose Git as the source of truth and use your Git credentials to
    access and modify your configurations.</p><p>With Harness Git Experience, you
    can select the repository and branch from where you want to execute your Pipelines,
    hence simplifying your Pipeline execution by seamless access to your Harness resources
    and their configurations stored in Git.</p><p>For more information, refer to <a
    href="https://docs.harness.io/article/xl028jo9jk-git-experience-overview">Harness
    Git Experience Overview</a>.</p><p>This functionality is behind a feature flag:
    NG_GIT_EXPERIENCE</p><h3>February 24, 2022</h3><h4>Harness Platform</h4><p><strong>Variables
    panel in the Template Studio</strong></p><p>Create and manage all the variables
    used in the stage templates with the variables panel in the Template Studio.</p><p>For
    more information, refer to <a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/s3wrqjsg43-add-a-stage-template#option_variables">Variables</a>.</p><p>This
    functionality is behind a feature flag: NG_TEMPLATES</p><h3>February 1, 2022</h3><h4>Continuous
    Delivery</h4><p><strong>Support for Native Help deployments</strong></p><p>Harness
    now supports Native Helm deployments in NG. You must always have Helm and Tiller
    running on one pod in your target cluster and Tiller makes the API calls to Kubernetes.
    You can only perform a Rolling deployment strategy. You can run commands like
    helm install, helm upgrade, etc with relevant command flags. Previously only K8s
    Helm was supported in NG. In CG, Harness supports various Helm Chart stores like
    HTTP Helm, S3, GCS, etc.</p><p>For more information, refer to <a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/lbhf2h71at-native-helm-quickstart">Native
    Helm Deployment Tutorial</a>.</p><p>This functionality is behind a feature flag:
