(PIE-3886)</li><li>Added support for adding cloning pipelines. (PIE-3878, PIE-3819)</li><li>Secret cache in NG has been revamped to store Encryption details. These details are being fetched from NG manager via rest api call from CG manager, which increases latency during task queuing. With this cache, we will substantially reduce this latency. (DEL-4288)</li><li>Added search by delegate tags functionality in UI (DEL-4230)</li><li>Delegate entities will be hard deleted on deleting parent org/project. And users will be able to recreate with the same identifier. (DEL-4202)</li><li>Add the support of scoping single delegate to an environment or pipeline or stage. (DEL-4159)<br/>For CD pipelines, introducing the option to add delegate selectors at pipeline level, stage level and step group level along with existing step level and connector level.<br/>With this change in place task selectors are chosen with a clearly defined hierarchy applied.The priority will be (in order of precedence): Delegates selectors at Step level &gt; Delegates selectors at stage &gt; Delegates selectors at pipeline &gt; Delegate selectors at Connectors.</li><li>On the delegate list page, adding the ability to do partial search with tag names as well as introducing a new filter option with delegate tags to search. (DEL-4151)</li><li>Improved the logic of delegate token validation to make it more performant (DEL-3998)</li><li>Removed <code>io_netty_netty</code> dependency from delegates (DEL-3798)Pipeline<ul><li>New support for adding cloning pipelines. (PIE-4262)Continuous Integration<ul><li>We now support builds for MacOs VM&#39;s from CI. See <a href="https://ngdocs.harness.io/article/mwzlb0x2mt" target="_blank">Define a MacOS Build Infrastructure in AWS</a>. (CI-4368)</li><li>Users can now use Azure Repos connectors in pipeline codebase configuration and triggers. (CI-4825)</li><li>Updated VM icon. (CI-4630)</li><li>The &#34;Build&#34; filter now includes Dashboards with Test Intelligence panels added. (CDB-233)Continuous Deployment<ul><li>Deleting Orphaned Resources During K8s Deployment feature is now behind the Feature Flag <code>PRUNE_KUBERNETES_RESOURCES_NG</code> (CDS-39364)</li><li>Supporting AWS Connector with Cross-account access (STS) for Serverless Swimlane (CDS-39010)</li><li>Supporting AWS Connector with credential types( Assume IAM role on Delegate and Use IRSA) for Serverless Swimlane. (CDS-38924)</li><li>After adding multiple artifact support, we support the following expressions in serverless YAML, to include the following artifacts. (CDS-38895)<ul><li>For Primary Artifact:<ul><li>Artifactory → <code>&lt;+artifact.path&gt;</code></li><li>ECR → <code>&lt;+artifact.image&gt;</code></li></ul></li><li>For Sidecar Artifacts:<ul><li>Both Artifactory and ECR → <code>&lt;+sidecar.artifact.identifierName&gt;</code>   <br/>Where identifierName is the identifier which customer gives when specifying a sidecar artifact in the pipeline</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Allow adding of ECR artifact for serverless stage (CDS-38857)</li><li>Support for Azure deployments using cluster user kubeconfig. (CDS-38131)</li><li>These are the assumptions/expectations for AKS cluster config:<ul><li>AKS managed AAD (enabled or disabled)</li><li>Kubernetes RBAC enabled</li><li>Azure RBAC (enabled or disabled): See <a href="https://ngdocs.harness.io/article/sjjik49xww-kubernetes-cluster-connector-settings-reference#deployments_cd" target="_blank">Kubernetes Cluster Connector Settings Reference</a></li><li>AKS property disableLocalAccounts (enabled or disabled)</li><li>SPN or MSI azure permissions (these are necessary regardless if you are using kubernetes RBAC or Azure RBAC)</li><li>Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries/read</li><li>Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries/builds/read</li><li>Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries/metadata/read</li><li>Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries/pull/read</li><li>Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/read</li><li>Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/listClusterUserCredential/action</li><li>Microsoft.Resource/subscriptions/resourceGroup/read</li><li>For Native Helm deployments to AKS:<ul><li>Helm version must be &gt; 3.2.0 (currently we version 3.8.0 installed on delegate which is used only when Feature Flag &#34;HELM_VERSION_3_8_0&#34; is activated)</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Terraform plan step now outputs `detailedExitCode` output variable. (CDS-36326)<ul><li>This detailed exit code is by terraform plan (<a href="https://www.terraform.io/cli/commands/plan">https://www.terraform.io/cli/commands/plan</a>) and users can use this to work with other steps in the pipeline.</li><li>Info on detailed-exit-code:</li><li>detailed-exitcode - Returns a detailed exit code when the command exits. When provided, this argument changes the exit codes and their meanings to provide more granular information about what the resulting plan contains:</li><li>0 = Succeeded with empty diff (no changes)</li><li>1 = Error</li><li>2 = Succeeded with non-empty diff (changes present)</li></ul></li><li>CD now supports clearing orphaned resources from a k8s cluster during Blue-Green and Rolling Deployments. See <a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/t7phv4eowh"><code>Prune Kubernetes Resources</code></a>.Cloud Cost Management<ul><li>User will be redirected to dry run tab after creating a dry run rule (CCM-7928)</li><li>On Perspectives, users received two duplicate CSV files while requesting a single download. (CCM-7908)</li><li>Improved browser tab titles. (CCM-7869)</li><li>You can now set notification channel to Slack and add multiple webhook urls when creating a budget. (CCM-7816)</li><li>Now, user can group by based on cloud provider also. (CCM-7543)</li><li>Now while creating perspective, you will see one more Preferences tab to select the preferences for a particular perspective. On the Perspective page, you can toggle the preferences flag to see your cost in the perspective chart section. (CCM-7436)</li><li>Clients can choose to show/hide `Others` and `Unallocated cost` in the perspective&#39;s chart section. (CCM-7254)</li></ul><h3>Issues Fixed in This Release</h3><ul><li>Fixed issue with Datadog metric collection. (SRM-1104, ZD-32514)</li><li>Verification is not happening correctly when we configure MS using templates. Verify step for Template type monitored service was not working due to a missing record in the database. For such use cases, we use a transient entity. Updated to code to support both transient and persisted entities. (SRM-11097)</li><li>Data Collection for CustomLogs is failing in Verification step (SRM-11003)<ul><li>The Custom Log Health Source feature was unable to collect and process the data in the Verify step. This feature uses different DSL scripts to collect log data and service instance (host) data. If the log data collection DSL can also provide the host data, we do not need the host data DSL explicitly. However, in this case, the log collection DSL was also being used to collect the host data, which led to a Type mismatch error during the data processing. By removing the use of log collection DSL as the host collection DSL, we are able to pull the host data from the log data itself and it also ceases the exception. This feature is now working correctly.</li></ul></li><li>Creation of Custom Health Source Metrics for Service based is failing (SRM-11002)<ul><li>The Custom Metric Source Health did not work if the data query type was of type Service. The issue was happening due to a validation on the field metricPath in the Json response mapping, which is not present for the given query type. The given field is now optional. This issue has been resolved.</li></ul></li><li>Deployment Stage template CV not working (SRM-10934)</li><li>Email Notification is failing with invalid template message. Add the body into a string and also add HTML tags.(SRM-10923)</li><li>Reset perpetual task for Prometheus for authentication. (SRM-10896)</li><li>Fixed an issue in creating perpetual task in case of compatibility issues. (SRM-10829)</li><li>Prometheus verification failing logs unhelpful. (SRM-10716)</li><li>Fix PreQA startup failing because of jdk11 update (SRM-10709)</li><li>Negative Value Validation required at backend for notification-rule/{identifier} api added NULL checks (SRM-10682)</li><li>Fixed a null pointer exception in data collection for verify step. (SRM-10674)</li><li>Incorrect order of events in verify step&#39;s log cluster view. fixed sorting orders. (SRM-10665)</li><li>Fixed sorting orders. (SRM-10656)</li><li>Yaml added for Prometheus connector with username and password. (SRM-10653, ZD-31038)</li><li>Notifications are triggered even when analysis is OFF (SRM-10652)</li><li>Add exception if a different NotificationRuleType is added into a different Entity (SRM-10632)</li><li>Two APIs are failing in Verify Step for customappd health source. Added NULL checks. (SRM-10631)</li><li>Not able to create an SLO with GCP as metrics (SRM-10594)</li><li>Show exception to users when save fails for metric data collection. (SRM-10551, ZD-30562)</li><li>Fixed a bug in cloudwatch EC2 timeseries analysis which was causing analysis to finish without any actual analysis. (SRM-10276, ZD-30292)</li><li>Changed metricIdentifier and metricName position in constructor (SRM-10161)</li><li>Fixed issue where users could not add custom metrics values and charts. (SRM-10099)</li><li>Can not set CCM license start date via API . (PLG-1344)</li><li>Fixed update file use-case for Git Sync Experience via Bitbucket cloud.<br/>Creating and updating file in Git Sync via Bitbucket cloud works fine. When we do some commits on unrelated files on git, then head of the branch moves ahead of the last commit on file. This results in failure of update of file via Harness UI. (PL-26564, ZD-32559)</li><li>Fixed issue with branch listing. (PL-26275)</li><li>The update of an Azure Connector didn&#39;t work in a Git Experience-enabled project. The issue has been resolved. The Azure Connector can now be updated for a Git Experience-enabled project. (PL-26216, ZD-32129)</li><li>Fixed issue: in audit log filter, &#34;Updated&#34; appears twice. Changed &#34;Updated&#34; to &#34;Upserted.&#34; (PL-25660)</li><li>When a secret starts with or ends with a space, the sanitization of secret does not work as per current implementation. Modified that. Now this case will be handled. (PL-25784)</li><li>Missed a few Account viewer roles in Migration. (PL-25758)</li><li>Account Viewer role is not visible for Role Assignment on User Invite (PL-25742)</li><li>Prevented G-zipping of video files on CDN. Also, for CDN cache invalidation, changed the hashes of files. (PL-25539)</li><li>Subscription MAUs and Developer Count Reversed (PLG-1239)</li><li>Subscription Prices Endpoint Should Use ModuleType enum (PLG-1192)</li><li>Getting branch name empty error while fetching pipeline from default branch (PL-25914)</li><li>The casing of the word &#34;Connectors&#34; has been changed in the autocomplete dropdown in order to be consistent with API when the user tries the following endpoint: <code>https://harness.io/docs/api/tag/Connectors#operation/getConnectorListV2!ct=application/json&amp;path=filterType&amp;t=request</code> (PL-25424)</li><li>The API (listConnectorByFQN) now correctly return back all the available connectors. In case the connector is git synced, the connector from the default branch is returned as part of response list. (PL-25364, ZD-30901)</li><li>We updated open api spec typo to change SecretFileSpe to SecretFileSpec. This won&#39;t have any change in API but will have change if someone was using autogenerated client. (PL-25360)</li><li>In case no project was saved in PreferenceFramework (because it&#39;s disabled currently), DeleteProject was throwing an error as it was trying to access an &#39;undefined&#39; project (PL-25337)</li><li>Earlier duplicate redis events (like referring to a connector in 2 stages of the same pipeline) was giving a bulk update exception, which lead to none of the instances being stored. Now we are checking for duplicates and storing only one instance. (PL-25264)</li><li>Fixed issue: Audit Trail showing incorrect timezone. (PL-24878)</li><li>Your preferred default experience will now be used to redirect you to the correct version when you open <code>app.harness.io</code>. (PL-24779)</li><li>Publish audit is failing in PROD when the new YAML size is greater than the defined size. (PL-24426)</li><li>Replaced numbers with Previous and Next buttons.

(PL-21623)</li><li>Unexpected behavior on clicking the popup message in connectors page. (PL-21534)</li><li>Added new email validations. (PIE-4394)</li><li>Fixed issue: Unable to view execution view of pipeline when retrying a failed pipeline. (PIE-4334)</li><li>Pipelines with Deploy stage templates are not listed on the Pipelines listing page​. (PIE-4298, ZD-29735, ZD-32185)</li><li>Updated the condition to show conditionalExecution icon on stages. (PIE-4277)</li><li>Removed matrix parent nodes from execution console view list. (PIE-4271)</li><li>Fixed issue: Builds page is blocking entire UI for loading state. Adjusted to not block the UI. (PIE-4213)</li><li>Builds page was blocking the entire UI​. (PIE-4213)</li><li>Overlay InputSet Creation API did not have the correct parameters. (PIE-4210)</li><li>The Input set was not showing the YAML file name correctly​. (PIE-4202)</li><li>Fixed webhook trigger issue. (PIE-4109)</li><li>Fix added to check service tab is rendered after YAML snippet API success. (PIE-4108)</li><li>UI fix: move Rerun icon to the right.
