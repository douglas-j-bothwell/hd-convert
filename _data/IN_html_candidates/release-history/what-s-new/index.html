This means you can now connect an application that uses PHP when using Harness Feature Flags. </p><p>For more information about the PHP SDK, go to the <a href="/article/3qrik15pkz-php-sdk-reference" target="_blank">PHP Reference Guide</a> or for general information about Feature Flag SDKs, go to our <a href="/category/eyzngtupao-sdk-overview" target="_blank">SDK Overview</a>.</p><p>To get the PHP SDK, go to our <a href="https://github.com/harness/ff-php-server-sdk" target="_blank">PHP Git Repository</a>.</p><h3>September 7, 2022</h3><ul><li>You can now inherit User Groups created at a higher scope by using <strong>Assign Roles.</strong><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/articles/8c1rry91s1/1662609334005/screenshot-2022-06-06-at-12-01-40-pm.png" style="max-height:50%;max-width:50%" data-hd-height="50%" data-hd-width="50%"/></figure>See <a href="/article/dfwuvmy33m-add-user-groups#step_assign_roles">Assign Roles</a>.</li></ul><h3>August 31, 2022</h3><h4>Harness Platform</h4><ul><li>Git Experience in Next Gen is now enhanced and simplified.<br/>See <a href="/article/xl028jo9jk-git-experience-overview">Git Experience</a>.</li><li>You can now switch branches directly from the Pipeline execution history. This will make it easier to switch branches straight from execution history rather than going to the Pipeline studio first and then returning to execution history. (PIE-4985)</li><li>You can now view the past 10 executions of the Pipelines and sort them from the table. You can also go to a specific execution by clicking on it. (PIE-4903)</li></ul><h3>August 25, 2022</h3><h4>Feature Flags</h4><p>You can now configure the <a href="/article/q0kvq8nd2o-relay-proxy" target="_blank">Relay Proxy</a> for Feature Flags to load and use configuration data that is stored offline. This means in case of an outage, you can still use the Proxy with the configuration you set. To use this feature, you need to generate the offline configuration and then run the Proxy in offline mode. For more information about how to do this, go to the <a href="/article/q0kvq8nd2o-relay-proxy" target="_blank">Relay Proxy overview</a> and <a href="/article/rae6uk12hk-deploy-relay-proxy#run_the_relay_proxy_in_offline_mode" target="_blank">Run the Proxy in offline mode</a>.</p><p>The Feature Flag Relay Proxy has been updated to version 0.9.7.</p><h4>Continuous Integration</h4><ul><li>This release includes a new Git Clone step that clones a repo separate from the repo specified in the Codebase object.
