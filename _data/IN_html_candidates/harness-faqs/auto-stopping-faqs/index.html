<p>This article addresses some frequently asked questions about <a href="/article/wzr5tz0ero-auto-stopping-rules">Harness intelligent cloud AutoStopping Rules</a>:</p><ul><li><a href="https://ngdocs.harness.io/article/9geon4cs13-auto-stopping-faqs#aws">AWS</a></li><li><a href="https://ngdocs.harness.io/article/9geon4cs13-auto-stopping-faqs#azure">Azure</a></li></ul><h3>AWS</h3><h5>What are AutoStopping Rules?</h5><p>AutoStopping Rules make sure that your non-production resources run only when used, and never when idle. It also allows you to run your workloads on fully orchestrated spot instances without any worry of spot interruptions. For more information, see <a href="/article/wzr5tz0ero-auto-stopping-rules">AutoStopping Rules Overview</a>.</p><h5>How do AutoStopping Rules access the AWS VMs?</h5><p>The VMs can be accessed using any of the following methods:</p><ul><li>DNS Link</li><li>SSH/RDP</li></ul><p>For more information, see <a href="/article/7025n9ml7z-create-autostopping-rules-aws#setup_access_using_dns_link">Setup Access Using DNS Link</a> and <a href="/article/7025n9ml7z-create-autostopping-rules-aws#setup_access_using_ssh_rdp">Setup Access Using SSH/RDP</a>.</p><h5>Do AutoStopping Rules need a load balancer like Application Load Balancer (ALB) for non-prod workloads?</h5><p>Yes, you need to create an Application Load Balancer (ALB) for AWS. A load balancer serves as the single point of contact for clients. The load balancer distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, in multiple Availability Zones. This increases the availability of your application.</p><p>An Application Load Balancer makes routing decisions at the application layer (HTTP/HTTPS), supports path-based routing, and can route requests to one or more ports on each container instance in your cluster.</p><p>For more information, see <a href="/article/eba1bn2jm6-create-load-balancer-aws">Create an Application Load Balancer for AWS</a>.</p><h5>Can I use Route 53 as my DNS provider?</h5><p>You can use Amazon Route 53 as the DNS service for your domain, such as example.com. When Route 53 is your DNS service, it routes internet traffic to your website by translating friendly domain names (such as <code>www.example.com</code>) into the numeric IP addresses (such as <code>192.0.2.1</code>) that computers use to connect to each other.</p><p>For more information, see <a href="/article/eba1bn2jm6-create-load-balancer-aws">Create an Application Load Balancer for AWS</a>.</p><h5>Can I use any other DNS provider other than Route 53?</h5><p>Yes, you can use other DNS providers like GoDaddy, HostGator, and so on to map your custom domain to the hostname.

But this solution has many limitations, often making it an ineffective or infeasible option:</p><ul><li>Impossible to statically predict idle times, especially during work hours.</li><li>Teams can’t access stopped machines with forceful shutdowns.</li><li>No optimization of compute, only start/stop actions.</li></ul><p><strong>Cloud AutoStopping solves the problems of idle cloud wastage and automated cost savings. </strong>Customers can now run non-production workloads on fully-orchestrated spot instances and turn them off whenever idle, saving on cloud costs to the most granular extent possible. It’s a dynamic solution to a pressing customer problem or set of them. In particular, Cloud AutoStopping enables customers to solve for the following use cases:</p><ul><li>Automatically detect idle times and shut down (on-demand) or terminate (spot) resources.</li><li>Automatically restart resources whenever there is traffic or usage requests.</li><li>Stopped/terminated machines are always accessible using the same access patterns that the team is used to – DNS link, SSH, RDP, background tasks.</li><li>Enable running workloads on fully-orchestrated spot instances without worrying about spot interruptions.</li></ul><p>Together, this helps customers achieve savings that are 2-3x that of any static resource scheduler, with none of the access issues. It also significantly reduces the barrier to adoption across an organization.</p><h5>How AutoStopping Rules can help when I am using Amazon EC2 Reserved Instances (RIs) for non-prod workloads?</h5><p>Using AutoStopping with either on-demand instances or spot instances will results in 70%+ savings without any long-term commitments or upfront payments. With RIs, you can save up to ~ 60-65% (lower savings) and you have long-term (1-3yrs+) commitments and upfront payments (for highest savings). So it is beneficial to release RIs and use AutoStopping with on-demand or spot.</p><h5>How spot instance interruptions are handled?</h5><p>In the event of spot interruption, an alternate spot instance is provisioned. In case there is no alternate spot available we fall back to on-demand and continue to poll for spot capacity. Once a spot capacity is available, we do a reverse fall-back from on-demand to spot.</p><p></p><p>All this is automated, with no manual intervention.</p><h3>Azure</h3><h5>How do AutoStopping Rules access the AWS VMs?</h5><p>The VMs can be accessed using any of the following methods:</p><ul><li>DNS Link</li><li>SSH/RDP</li></ul><h5 id="undefined">Do AutoStopping Rules need an Application Gateway or Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF) for non-prod workloads?</h5><p>Yes, you need to create an Application Gateway for Azure. Azure Application Gateway is a web traffic load balancer that enables you to manage traffic to your web applications. Application Gateway can make routing decisions based on additional attributes of an HTTP request, for example, URI path or host headers.</p><p>For more information, see <a href="/article/d43tsblpma-create-an-application-gateway-for-azure">Create an Application Gateway for Azure</a>.</p><h5>How AutoStopping Rules can help when I shut down my VMs during non-working hours?</h5><p>Before Cloud AutoStopping, the only other option to solve these problems was the use of static resource schedulers (third-party tools or in-house scripts).
