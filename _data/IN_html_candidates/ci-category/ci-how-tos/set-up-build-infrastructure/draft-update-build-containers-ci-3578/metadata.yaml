  title: DRAFT Update Build Containers CI-3578

  body: '<p>Harness publishes updates for CI build containers as described below.
    CI build images are updated twice a month, and each image is backwards-compatible
    with the previous two releases. This provides a one-month window if you want to
    run security scans or other tests on new images before deploying them in your
    infrastructure.</p><h3>CI Build Image Updates</h3><p>Harness updates <code>harness/ci-*</code>
    images such as <code>harness/ci-addon</code> and <code>harness/ci-lite-engine</code>
    as follows:</p><ul><li>Harness publishes updates of all CI images on the second
    and fourth Monday of each month.</li><li>Version numbers use an x.y.z format:
    x = major release, y = minor release, z = patch release.</li><li>All images are
    supported for the latest three releases: latest, latest-1, and latest-2. Each
    image release is backward-compatible with the previous two releases.</li><li>You
    can choose to deploy the latest containers immediately upon release, or download
    and scan them before deploying.</li><li>If your builds use containers that are
    more than two releases old, the UI shows a warning that the image versions are
    no longer supported. The builds won&#39;t fail automatically.</li><li>If a hot
    fix or security fix is required for a specific image, Harness will create hotfixes
    for the latest three images. <span style="color:#d33115" data-hd-color="#d33115"><strong>TBD</strong>
    --  How will customers know when a patch or hotfix has been released?      </span></li><li></li></ul><h3>Drone
