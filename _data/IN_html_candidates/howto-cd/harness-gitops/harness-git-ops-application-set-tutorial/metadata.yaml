  body: '<div class="note-callout">Currently, this feature is behind the feature flags<code>ARGO_PHASE2_MANAGED</code>.
    Contact <a href="mailto:support@harness.io" target="_blank">Harness Support</a> to
    enable the feature.</div><p>You can use an ApplicationSet controller to distribute a
    single Application across a large number of clusters. </p><p>An ApplicationSet
    allows you to automatically and dynamically generate Harness GitOps Applications.
    An ApplicationSet is similar to an Application but uses a template part that contains
    all fields defined from the spec part of the Application (CR).</p><p>Harness will
    generate Applications based on the ApplicationSet, which </p><p>ApplicationSet
    is supported in your cluster using a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/">Kubernetes
    controller</a> for the <code>ApplicationSet</code> <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/">CustomResourceDefinition</a> (CRD).
    </p><p>You add an ApplicationSet manifest to your Harness GitOps Application just
    like you would add a typical Deployment manifest.</p><p>The ability to use a single
    Kubernetes manifest to target multiple Kubernetes clusters with Argo CD</p><ul><li>The
    ability to use a single Kubernetes manifest to deploy multiple applications from
    one or multiple Git repositories with Argo CD</li><li>Improved support for monorepos:
    in the context of Argo CD, a monorepo is multiple Argo CD Application resources
    defined within a single Git repository</li><li>Within multitenant clusters, improves
    the ability of individual cluster tenants to deploy applications using Argo CD
    (without needing to involve privileged cluster administrators in enabling the
    destination clusters/namespaces)</li></ul><p></p>'
