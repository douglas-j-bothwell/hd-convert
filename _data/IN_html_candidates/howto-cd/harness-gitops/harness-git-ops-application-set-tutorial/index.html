Contact <a href="mailto:support@harness.io" target="_blank">Harness Support</a> to enable the feature.</div><p>You can use an ApplicationSet controller to distribute a single Application across a large number of clusters. </p><p>An ApplicationSet allows you to automatically and dynamically generate Harness GitOps Applications. An ApplicationSet is similar to an Application but uses a template part that contains all fields defined from the spec part of the Application (CR).</p><p>Harness will generate Applications based on the ApplicationSet, which </p><p>ApplicationSet is supported in your cluster using a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/">Kubernetes controller</a> for the <code>ApplicationSet</code> <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/">CustomResourceDefinition</a> (CRD). </p><p>You add an ApplicationSet manifest to your Harness GitOps Application just like you would add a typical Deployment manifest.</p><p>The ability to use a single Kubernetes manifest to target multiple Kubernetes clusters with Argo CD</p><ul><li>The ability to use a single Kubernetes manifest to deploy multiple applications from one or multiple Git repositories with Argo CD</li><li>Improved support for monorepos: in the context of Argo CD, a monorepo is multiple Argo CD Application resources defined within a single Git repository</li><li>Within multitenant clusters, improves the ability of individual cluster tenants to deploy applications using Argo CD (without needing to involve privileged cluster administrators in enabling the destination clusters/namespaces)</li></ul><p></p>
