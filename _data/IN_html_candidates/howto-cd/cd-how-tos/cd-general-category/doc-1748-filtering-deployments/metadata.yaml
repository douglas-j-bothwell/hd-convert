    2: Filter by Deployment</h3><p>To filter by <strong>Deployment Type</strong>,
    select the deployment and click <strong>Apply</strong>. Additionally, you can
    select from <strong>Services</strong> and <strong>Environments</strong> to include
    them with the filter.</p><h3>Option 3: Filter by Statuses</h3><p>In <strong>Status</strong>,
    select all of the statuses you want to filter on.</p><h3>Option 4: Filter by Build
    Type</h3><p>In <strong>Build Type</strong>, select the type of build by which
    you want to filter.</p><h3>Step: Save a Filter</h3><p>You can save a filter for
    a Pipeline or a Deployment that meets a specific criterial. For example, you can
    specify Kubernetes for <strong>Deployment Type</strong> and save that filter for
    future use. The saved filter is now available in the list of filters.</p><p></p><figure><img
