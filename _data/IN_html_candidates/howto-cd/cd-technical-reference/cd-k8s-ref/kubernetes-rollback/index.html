<p>If a Harness Kubernetes deployment fails, Harness will rollback to the last successful version of your workload.</p><p>Harness follows standard Kubernetes behavior during rollback. See <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#-em-undo-em-" target="_blank">kubectl rollout undo</a>.</p><h3>Workload Rollback Only</h3><div class="note-callout"><strong>Rollback rolls back workloads only.</strong> If there are other objects or operations executed in your stage, Harness does not roll those back.</div><p>For details on Harness Kubernetes workloads, see <a href="/article/efnlvytc6l-what-can-i-deploy-in-kubernetes">What Can I Deploy in Kubernetes?</a>.</p><h3>Scaling and Rollback</h3><p>Each time Harness deploys, the deployment gets new replicas that get scaled up and the old replicas are scaled down.</p><p>By default, Kubernetes keeps the last 10 revisions as <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/" target="_blank">ReplicaSets</a>.</p><p>When Harness performs rollback it identifies which revision number to use (<code>rollback-to</code>). Harness identifies that last successful ReplicaSet, and selects it to be scaled up.</p><h3>Rollback and Artifacts</h3><p>The artifact(s) used for the replicas that are scaled up as part of rollback are simply the artifact(s) from the time that version was deployed.</p><h3>Blue/Green Rollbacks</h3><p>In the case of Blue/Green, the resources are not versioned because a Blue/Green deployment uses <strong>rapid rollback</strong>: network traffic is simply routed back to the original instances.</p><p>You do not need to redeploy previous versions of the service/artifact and the instances that comprised their environment.</p><h3>Rolling Rollback Step</h3><p>You can add a <strong>Rolling</strong> <strong>Rollback</strong> step to roll back the workloads deployed by the <a href="/article/xsla71qg8t-create-a-kubernetes-rolling-deployment">Rolling Deployment</a> step.</p><p>Simply add this step where you want to initiate a rollback. Note that this step applies to the deployments of the Rolling Deployment command, and not the <a href="/article/00el61pzok-deploy-manifests-separately-using-apply-command">Apply Step</a>.</p><h3>See Also</h3><ul><li><a href="/article/knunou9j30-kubernetes-cd-quickstart">Kubernetes CD Quickstart</a></li><li><a href="/category/qfj6m1k2c4-cd-kubernetes-category">Kubernetes How-tos</a></li><li><a href="/article/u29v1uc1mh-kubernetes-deployments-overview">Kubernetes Deployments Overview</a></li></ul><p></p>
