  body: <p>The <strong>Canary Delete</strong> step is used to clean up the workload
    deployed by the <a href="/article/17wrdeuv0x-canary-deployment-step">Canary Deployment</a> step.</p><p>The
    Canary Delete step usually follows a Canary Deployment step.</p><p>If the <strong>Canary
    Deployment</strong> step is successful, the stage will move onto the Primary step
    group and the Rolling Deployment step. The workload created by the <strong>Canary
    Deployment</strong> step is no longer needed.</p><h3>Canary Delete step vs Kubernetes
    Delete step</h3><p>The <strong>Canary Delete</strong> step is only used to delete
    resources created using the <strong>Canary Deployment</strong> step. To delete
    <u>any Kubernetes resources</u>, use the Kubernetes Delete step. For details,
    go to <a href="/article/eaj0xuegln-delete-kubernetes-resources">Delete Kubernetes
    Resources with the Kubernetes Delete Step</a>.</p><h3>Name</h3><p>Enter a name
    for the step.</p><h3>Timeout</h3><p>How long Harness should run this step before
    failing it. Enter a minimum of 10m to account for network activity in your target
