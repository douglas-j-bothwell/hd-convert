<p>Every Harness deployment creates a new release with an incrementally increasing number. Release history is stored in the Kubernetes cluster in a ConfigMap. This ConfigMap is essential for release tracking, versioning and rollback.</p><p>By default, all the ConfigMap and <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/" target="_blank">Secrets</a> resources are versioned by Harness. Corresponding references in PodSpec are also updated with versions.</p><p>You can see the use of release numbers and versioning in the <strong>Deployments</strong> page details:</p><pre class="hljs css">INFO   2019-02-15 10:53:33    Kind                Name                                    Versioned <br/>INFO   2019-02-15 10:53:33    Namespace           default                                 false     <br/>INFO   2019-02-15 10:53:33    Secret              image-pull-secret                       false     <br/>INFO   2019-02-15 10:53:33    Secret              sample                                  true      <br/>INFO   2019-02-15 10:53:33    Deployment          nginx-deployment                        false     <br/>INFO   2019-02-15 10:53:33    <br/>INFO   2019-02-15 10:53:33    <br/>INFO   2019-02-15 10:53:33    Current release number is: 5<br/>INFO   2019-02-15 10:53:33    <br/>INFO   2019-02-15 10:53:33    Previous Successful Release is 4</pre><div class="note-callout">Versioning does not change how you use Secrets. You do not need to reference versions when using Secrets.</div><p>For cases where versioning is not required, the manifest entered in the Harness Service Manifests section should be annotated with <code>harness.io/skip-versioning: &#34;true&#34;</code>.</p><p>For example. you might want to skip versioning is for an ImagePullSecret because it never changes, or for TLS certs if they are referred in a Kubernetes container cmd args.</p><p>Harness also uses a release name for tracking releases. You can supply a release name in a stage&#39;s Infrastructure Definition Cluster Details <strong>Release Name</strong> setting in <strong>Advanced</strong>.</p><p>See .</p><p></p>
