<p>This topic lists the deployment log size, export, and viewing limits.</p><h3>Limitations</h3><p>Harness deployment logging has the following limitations:</p><ul><li>A hard limit of 25MB for logs produced by 1 Stage step. Logs beyond this limit will be skipped and not available for download as well.</li><li>Harness always saves the final log line that contains the status (Success, Failure, etc) even if logs go beyond the limit.</li><li>In cases where the final log line is itself very large and logs are already beyond max limit (25MB), Harness shows a limited portion of the line from the end (10KB of data for the log line).</li></ul><p></p>
