    class="note-callout">Harness provide multiple options for controlling resource
    usage and protecting capacity limits. See <a href="/article/7ogetmgq7y-controlling-deployments-with-barriers-resource-constraints-and-queue-steps">Controlling
    Resource Usage with Barriers, Resource Constraints, and Queue Steps</a>.</div><h3>Resource
    Constraints Summary</h3><p>Harness will only allow one Stage to deploy to the
    same Service and Infrastructure Definition combination at the same time. The Stages
    are typically in different Pipelines, but Resource Constrain also apply to Stages
    in the same Pipeline run in parallel.</p><p>Harness queues deployments to ensure
    that two Service and Infrastructure Definition combinations are not deploying
    at the same time.</p><p>Once the first Stage in the queue is done deploying, the
    next Stage in the queue can deploy to that Service and Infrastructure Definition
    combination.</p><h3>Disabling Resource Constraints</h3><p>If you want to allow
    multiple Pipelines to deploy to the same Infrastructure simultaneously, enable
    the <strong>Allow simultaneous deployments on the same infrastructure</strong>
    option in the Stage&#39;s <strong>Infrastructure</strong> settings.</p><p></p><figure><img
