<p>Harness uses a Service-based license model to charge Harness customers using its Continuous Delivery module.</p><p>The CD License calculation uses the Active Services count and the number of Service Instances each active Service&#39;s deployment creates.</p><h3>Active Services</h3><p>Harness gets all Services that are part of any Pipeline execution (deployment) over the past <strong>30 Days</strong>. We call these a list of <strong>Active Services</strong>.</p><p></p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/articles/ihboxj8xlz/1658175095642/clean-shot-2022-07-18-at-13-11-06.png"/></figure><p>When determining Active Services, the status of the deployments does not matter. A Service is considered <u>Active</u> even if it was part of any failed deployments.</p><p>This includes if the Step involving a Service was skipped during a Pipeline execution.</p><p>For example, suppose a Pipeline has 4 different steps, each corresponding to a different Service: service1, service2, service3, service4.</p><p>When the Pipeline is run, Step 2 failed and the Pipeline skipped execution of Steps involving service3 and service4.</p><p>Harness still counts service3 and service4 as <strong>Active Services</strong> since they were part of a Pipeline execution (independent of the Pipeline execution status).</p><p>Also, the number of instances deployed does not matter here. A Service is considered Active even if the corresponding deployment(s) does not create any instance.</p><h3>How Service-based Licensing is Calculated</h3><p>For every Active Service found, Harness finds the <strong>95th Percentile</strong> of the number of its Service Instances across a period of 30 days.</p><p>The active CD License Usage is calculated as follows:</p><ul><li>Every Active Service consumes a <strong>minimum of ONE license</strong>.</li><li>For every additional 20 Service Instances (95th Percentile of Service Instances across a period of 30 days), Harness adds another license for the corresponding Service.</li></ul><div class="note-callout">This Service Instances count might or might not reflect the active instances as at the present time. Instead, it might reflect the 95th percentile count over last 30 days.</div><p></p><h3>Example</h3><p>Here&#39;s an example using 4 different Services.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Active Service</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>95th Percentile Active Instances</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Licenses Consumed</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Service 1</p></td><td><p>0</p></td><td><p>1</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Service 2</p></td><td><p>17</p></td><td><p>1</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Service 3</p></td><td><p>22</p></td><td><p>2</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Service 4</p></td><td><p>41</p></td><td><p>3</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p>
