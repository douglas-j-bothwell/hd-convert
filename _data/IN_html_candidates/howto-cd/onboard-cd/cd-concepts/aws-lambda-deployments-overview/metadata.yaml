    Steps</a></li></ul><h3>Before You Begin</h3><p>Before learning about, you should
    have an understanding of the following:</p><ul><li> <a href="/article/hv2758ro4e-learn-harness-key-concepts">Learn
    Harness'' Key Concepts</a></li></ul><h3>What Does Harness Need Before You Start?</h3><p>A
    Harness AWS Lambda deployment requires the following:</p><ul><li>AWS account -
    An AWS account you can connect to Harness.</li><li>Lambda function file stored
    on an artifact server, typically AWS S3.</li></ul><h3>What Does Harness Deploy?</h3><p>Setting
    up a Lambda deployment is as simple as adding your function zip file, configuring
    function compute settings, and adding aliases and tags. Harness takes care of
    the rest of the deployment, making it consistent, reusable, and safe with automatic
    rollback.</p><figure><a href="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/articles/z24n8ut61d/1578087633031/image.png"><img
    src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/articles/z24n8ut61d/1578087633031/image.png"></a></figure><p>Basically,
    the Harness setup for Lambda is akin to using the AWS CLI&nbsp; <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/lambda/index.html#cli-aws-lambda"
    target="_blank">aws lambda</a>&nbsp; <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/lambda/create-function.html"
    target="_blank">create-function</a>,&nbsp; <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/lambda/update-function-code.html"
    target="_blank">update-function-code</a>, and&nbsp; <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/lambda/update-function-configuration.html"
    target="_blank">update-function-configuration</a>&nbsp;commands, as well as the
    many other commands that are needed.</p><p>The benefit with Harness is that you
    can set up your Lambda deployment once, with no scripting, and then have your
    Lambda functions deployed automatically as they are updated in your AWS S3 bucket.
    You can even templatize the deployment Environment and Workflow for use by other
    devops and developers in your team.</p><p>Furthermore, Harness manages Lambda
    function versioning to perform rollback when needed.</p><h3>What Does a Harness
    AWS Lambda Deployment Involve?</h3><p>The following list describes the major steps
    of a Harness AWS Lambda deployment:</p><p></p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Step</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Name</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Description
    and Links</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>Install the Harness
    Shell Script or ECS&nbsp;<strong>Delegate</strong>&nbsp;in AWS.</p></td><td><p>Typically,
    the Shell Script or ECS Delegate is installed in the same AWS VPC as your Lambda
    functions.</p><p>When you set up a Harness AWS Cloud Provider, you can use the
    same IAM credentials as the installed Delegate.</p><p>The IAM role you assign
    to the Delegate requires the standard Lambda Permissions.</p><p>See <a href="/article/2m0v9z5x7b-set-up-a-shell-script-delegate">Set
    Up a Shell Script Delegate</a> and <a href="/article/tbjffip7rp-set-up-an-aws-ecs-delegate">Set
    Up an AWS ECS Delegate</a>.</p><p>See <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-permissions.html"
    target="_blank">Lambda Permissions</a> from AWS.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>Add
    an <strong>AWS</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Cloud Provider</strong>.</p></td><td><p>An
    AWS&nbsp;Cloud Provider is a connection to your AWS account.</p><p>If you use
    AWS S3 to store your Lambda function files, the AWS&nbsp;Cloud Provider is used
    to obtain the Lambda function file from AWS S3.</p><p>The AWS&nbsp;Cloud Provider
    is also used to connect to Lambda and deploy your function.</p><p>When you set
    up a Harness AWS Cloud Provider, you can use the same IAM credentials as the installed
    Delegate.</p><p>See <a href="/article/bejr8ispzh-connect-to-amazon-web-services-aws-cloud">Connect
    to Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud</a>.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>Create
    the Harness&nbsp;<strong>Application</strong>&nbsp;for your Lambda CD Pipeline.</p></td><td><p>The
    Harness Application represents a group of microservices, their deployment pipelines,
    and all the building blocks for those pipelines. Harness represents your release
    process using a logical group of one or more entities: Services, Environments,
    Workflows, Pipelines, Triggers, and Infrastructure Provisioners. Applications
    organize all of the entities and configurations in Harness CD.</p><p>See <a href="/article/wrtkikaksk-add-an-application">Add
    an Application</a>.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>Create the Harness&nbsp;<strong>Service</strong>&nbsp;using
    the <strong>AWS Lambda</strong> Deployment Type.</p></td><td><p>Add a Lambda function
    file as an artifact in a Harness Service, define a function specification, and
    any config variables and files.</p><p>See <a href="/article/mp3etdiz5h-add-lambda-function-files">Add
    Lambda Function Files</a> and <a href="/article/lh63zq1db4-define-a-lambda-function-specification">Define
    a Lambda Function Specification</a>.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>5</p></td><td><p>Create
    the Harness&nbsp;<strong>Environment</strong>&nbsp;and Infrastructure Definition
    for your deployment, and any overrides.</p></td><td><p>Using the Harness AWS Cloud
    Provider you set up, you can select the IAM role, region, and other components
    of the target environment for your deployment.</p><p>You can also override any
    Service settings, such as config variables and files. This enables you to use
    a single Service with multiple Harness Environments.</p><p>See <a href="/article/1vv2jr7n55-define-your-aws-lambda-target-infrastructure">Define
    Your AWS Lambda Target Infrastructure</a>.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>6</p></td><td><p>Create
    the Basic deployment for Lambda in Harness&nbsp;<strong>Workflows</strong>.</p></td><td><p>The
    Workflow deploys the Lambda function as defined in the Harness Service to the
    AWS Lambda environment in the Harness Infrastructure Definition.</p><p>See <a
    href="/article/07o2d99x7j-create-a-basic-lambda-deployment">Create a Basic Lambda
    Deployment</a>.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>7</p></td><td><p>Deploy the Workflow.</p></td><td><p>Once
    you''ve deployed a Workflow, learn how to improve your AWS Lambda CD:</p><ul><li>
