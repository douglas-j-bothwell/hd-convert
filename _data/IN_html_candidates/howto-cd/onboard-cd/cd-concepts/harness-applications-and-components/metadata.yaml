  short_version: Brief overview of a Harness Application and its components.
  body: '<p>A Harness <strong>Application</strong> represents a group of microservices/applications,
    their deployment pipelines, and all the building blocks for those pipelines. Think
    of Application as projects that allow you to organize your CD goals.</p><p>Harness
    Applications represent your microservices/applications using a logical group of
    one or more entities: Services, Environments, Workflows, Pipelines, Triggers,
    and Infrastructure Provisioners. Applications organize all of the entities and
    configurations in Harness CD.&nbsp;</p><p>The following diagram displays how an
    Application organizes Services, Workflows, and Environments into components that
    can be selected and deployed using Pipelines (although you can deploy a Workflow
    by itself, also). The Artifact Servers and Cloud Providers you connect to your
    Harness account are used to obtain your microservices/applications and deploy
    them to your deployment environments.</p><p></p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/other/1569872525524/image.png"></figure><p>Keep
    this diagram in mind when setting up your Harness Application.</p><h4>Before You
    Begin</h4><ul><li><a href="/article/hv2758ro4e-learn-harness-key-concepts">Learn
    Harness'' Key Concepts</a></li></ul><h2>Create an Application</h2><p>The following
    procedure creates a new Application. Once you are done, you can add components
    to the Application, such as Services and Environments.</p><p>To create an Application,
    do the following:</p><ol><li>Click <strong>Setup</strong>, and then click <strong>Add
    Application</strong>. The <strong>Application</strong> dialog appears.<figure><img

    the name&nbsp;for your Application, and click <strong>SUBMIT</strong>. Your new
    Application appears.</li><li>Click your Applicationâ€™s name. The Application appears.<figure><img

    the steps in this checklist to add entities to your application:</li></ol><p></p><table

    href="/category/2yz0t8jhu8-howtos-services">Services</a></p></td><td><p>Services
    represent your microservices/apps. You define where the artifacts for those microservices
    come from, and the container specs, configuration variables, and files for those
    microservices.</p><p>Add your microservices, including their artifact sources,

    href="/category/j96pn50naw-howto-environments">Environments</a></p></td><td><p>Environments
    represent one or more of your deployment infrastructures, such as Dev, QA, Stage,
    Production, etc.</p><p>Add deployment Environments for the Services in your application.
    These Environments will be deployed on the cloud providers you added as a connector.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>How?</strong></p></td><td><p><a
    href="/category/f1yqv8anhu-howtos-workflows">Workflows</a></p></td><td><p>Workflows
    define how a Service is deployed, verified, and rolled back, among other important
    phases. There are many different types of Workflows, from Basic to Canary and
    Blue/Green.</p><p>Add Workflows to manage the stages of Service deployments.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>How?</strong></p></td><td><p><a
    href="/category/9911rs8ltb-howtos-pipelines">Pipelines</a></p></td><td><p>A Pipeline
    is a collection of one or more stages, containing workflows for one or more services
    and other deployment and verification steps.</p><p>Add a Pipeline to define the

    href="/category/yfpv3e5ai3-howtos-triggers">Triggers</a></p></td><td><p>Triggers
    automate deployments using a variety of conditions, such as Git events, new artifacts,

    href="/category/8jtjs2i7e2-howtos-infrastructure-prov">Infrastructure Provisioners</a></p></td><td><p>Infrastructure
    Provisioners define blueprints from known Infrastructure-as-Code technologies
    (Terraform, Cloud Formation, etc) and map the output (such as load balancers,
    VPCs, etc). They enable Workflows to provision infrastructure on the fly when
    deploying Services.</p><p>Add an Infrastructure Provisioner such as CloudFormation
    or Terraform as a blueprint for the system, networking, and security infrastructure
    for the Service deployment.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p>'
