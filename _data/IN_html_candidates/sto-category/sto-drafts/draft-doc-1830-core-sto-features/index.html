<h3>Prioritization &amp; Deduplication of Security Issues</h3><p>STO makes it easy to identify, troubleshoot, and resolve security issues. Every time you run a pipeline, STO aggregates, normalizes, and deduplicates all scan results a single list of security issues. <em>Deduplication</em> is the aggregation of multiple occurrences with the same root cause into one issue. </p><p>The <strong>Security Tests</strong> page is the single source of truth for all security issues detected in a build. All issues are listed by severity, from critical to minor. Click on any issue to view details such as:</p><ul><li>Severity score and description</li><li>Software libraries and versions that include the detected vulnerability</li><li>Links to relevant <a href="https://www.cve.org/" target="_blank">CVE</a> records and other relevant information</li><li>A list of all detected occurrences of the issue. Each occurrence shows the location and other useful information for troubleshoot that occurrence. </li></ul><h3>STO-based Governance Policies</h3><p>You can use the <a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/1d3lmhv4jl">Harness Policy Engine</a> to create policies based on the <a href="https://www.openpolicyagent.org/" target="_blank">Open Policy Agent (OPA)</a> standard. You can define governance policies to ensure that your repos, images, and artifacts comply with your organization&#39;s specific security requirements. For example, you can define policies such as:</p><ul><li>All pipelines must include a Security stage.</li><li>TBD</li><li>TBD</li></ul><h3>Orchestrate Scanners inside CI Pipeline</h3><p><a href="https://harness.io/products/security-testing-orchestration">Harness STO</a> integrates with multiple open source and commercial security scanners for secure pipeline development and security testing. Orchestrating application security scanners across software delivery and processing the output of the scanners allows for both enhanced application security and high delivery velocity. STO can be configured to be used with Harness CI/CD or in a standalone mode, integrating with any CI/CD tooling.</p><h3>Orchestrate Scanners inside CD Pipeline</h3><h3>Security Exemptions Review &amp; Approval</h3><p>Highlight page where secops users can view all the exemptions at once</p><p>Describe why security exemptions are important</p>
