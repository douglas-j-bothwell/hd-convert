  body: <h3>Prioritization &amp; Deduplication of Security Issues</h3><p>STO makes
    it easy to identify, troubleshoot, and resolve security issues. Every time you
    run a pipeline, STO aggregates, normalizes, and deduplicates all scan results
    a single list of security issues. <em>Deduplication</em> is the aggregation of
    multiple occurrences with the same root cause into one issue. </p><p>The <strong>Security
    Tests</strong> page is the single source of truth for all security issues detected
    in a build. All issues are listed by severity, from critical to minor. Click on
    any issue to view details such as:</p><ul><li>Severity score and description</li><li>Software
    libraries and versions that include the detected vulnerability</li><li>Links to
    relevant <a href="https://www.cve.org/" target="_blank">CVE</a> records and other
    relevant information</li><li>A list of all detected occurrences of the issue.
    Each occurrence shows the location and other useful information for troubleshoot
    that occurrence. </li></ul><h3>STO-based Governance Policies</h3><p>You can use
    the <a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/1d3lmhv4jl">Harness Policy Engine</a> to
    create policies based on the <a href="https://www.openpolicyagent.org/" target="_blank">Open
    Policy Agent (OPA)</a> standard. You can define governance policies to ensure
    that your repos, images, and artifacts comply with your organization&#39;s specific
    security requirements. For example, you can define policies such as:</p><ul><li>All
    pipelines must include a Security stage.</li><li>TBD</li><li>TBD</li></ul><h3>Orchestrate
    Scanners inside CI Pipeline</h3><p><a href="https://harness.io/products/security-testing-orchestration">Harness
    STO</a> integrates with multiple open source and commercial security scanners
    for secure pipeline development and security testing. Orchestrating application
    security scanners across software delivery and processing the output of the scanners
    allows for both enhanced application security and high delivery velocity. STO
    can be configured to be used with Harness CI/CD or in a standalone mode, integrating
    with any CI/CD tooling.</p><h3>Orchestrate Scanners inside CD Pipeline</h3><h3>Security
    Exemptions Review &amp; Approval</h3><p>Highlight page where secops users can
    view all the exemptions at once</p><p>Describe why security exemptions are important</p>
