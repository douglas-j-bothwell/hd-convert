  body: '<p>This topic describes the end-to-end workflow for setting up Security Testing
    Orchestration for your team members.</p><h3>Step 1: Add STO Roles to Users</h3><p>STO
    supports two roles for Security Testing:</p><ul><li><strong>Security Testing Developer</strong>
    — This role is needed for users to view issues, scans, test targets, and policy
    exemptions. Developers can also create new test targets and exemptions.</li><li><strong>Security
    Testing SecOps</strong> — SecOps users have all the permissions of Developers.
    Unlike developers SecOps users can also approve exemptions. An exemption is a
    policy that says: &#34;Ignore this specific vulnerability when you run scans over
    the next X days.&#34;</li></ul><p>Click <strong>Account Settings</strong> (left
    menu) &gt; <strong>Access Control</strong> and add one of these roles to each
    user.</p><h3>Step 2: Review the STO Quickstart</h3><p>The <a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/qhgshfw3mg"
    target="_blank">STO Quickstart</a> describes the recommended workflows for developers
    and SecOps users. This Quickstart will show you how to do the following:</p><ol><li>Add
    an STO Stage to a Pipeline.</li><li>Add a scanner to your Stage, configure it,
    and define the target to scan (in this case, a development branch).</li><li>Run
    the Pipeline and analyze the security issues found in the build.</li><li>Create
    a baseline branch and use the baseline to identify new vs. inherited issues in
    the development branch.</li><li>View issue details in the Harness UI and use these
    details to identify and resolve issues in your code.</li><li>Create exemptions
    to exclude specific vulnerabilities from your scan results (SecOps users only).</li></ol><h3>Step
    3: Add More Scanners to Your Pipelines</h3><p>Once you&#39;re familiar with STO
    workflows, you can add more scanners to your Pipelines. See the <a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/0k0iubnzql">Security
    Steps Technical Reference</a> for information about setting up specific scanners.</p><h3>Step
    4: Create Exemptions for Specific Issues</h3><p>An exemption is an &#34;ignore
    rule&#34; for a specific vulnerability that excludes it from the results of a
    specific scanner. Exemptions remove extraneous or unimportant issues from you
    scan results and make them easier to navigate. Each exemption has a specific time
    limit, and only SecOps users can approve exemptions. </p><p>Part 3 of the <a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/qhgshfw3mg">STO
    Quickstart </a>shows how to create and approve an exemption. </p><h3>Step 5: Add
    Governance Policies</h3><p>Harness Policy Engine uses <a href="https://www.openpolicyagent.org/"
    target="_blank">Open Policy Agent (OPA)</a> as the central service to store and
    enforce policies for the different entities and processes across the Harness platform.
    You can centrally define and store policies and then select where (which entities)
    and when (which events) they will be applied.</p><p>use governance policies and
    real-time security dashboards for ensuring critical security issues never make
    it to production. You can apply <a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/1d3lmhv4jl-harness-governance-overview">Harness
    existing OPA policy governance</a> to enforce your security testing practices
    and to ensure that critical security issues never make it into production.</p><h3>Step
    6: Create Custom Dashboards</h3><p>Custom Dashboards enable you to visualize and
    prioritize the deployment and related data that matters to you in flexible display
    formats. You might want to create custom dashboards that highlight security issues
    for specific users and groups in your organization. See <a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/ardf4nbvcy"
    target="_blank">Create Dashboards</a> and <a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/i4mtqea5es"
