  body: '<p>This document contains release notes for Harness SaaS.</p><div class="note-callout">For
    Harness On-Prem releases, see <a href="/article/0v512791gf-harness-on-prem-release-notes">Harness
    Self-Managed Enterprise Edition Release Notes</a>.</div><p>Release notes are displayed
    with the most recent release first.</p><div class="note-callout">If you don&#39;t
    see a new feature or enhancement in your Harness account, it might be behind a
    Feature Flag. Contact <a href="mailto:support@harness.io" target="_blank">Harness
    Support</a> to enable the feature.</div><p></p><h3>September 14th, 2022, version
    76708</h3><h4>Early Access</h4><ul><li>When using a Build Workflow followed by
    multiple Workflows in a Pipeline, you can now pass the same artifact from the
    first Build Workflow to rest of the Workflows in the Pipeline that deploy the
    same Harness Service (CDS-38955, ZD-31776)<br/>Execution of each Workflow will
    use the artifact collected by the last run Build Workflow in the Pipeline that
    has collected the artifact from the same Service.<br/>In the first Build Workflow&#39;s
    <strong>Artifact Collection</strong> step&#39;s <strong>Build/Tag</strong> setting,
    you specify the artifact to collect. For subsequent <strong>Artifact Collection</strong>
    steps in the same and subsequent Workflows in the Pipeline deploying the same
    Service, you can leave the <strong>Artifact Collection</strong> step&#39;s <strong>Build/Tag</strong>
    setting empty and Harness will use the artifact collected by the last Build Workflow
    in the Pipeline.<br/>This functionality requires the Feature Flag <code>SORT_ARTIFACTS_IN_UPDATED_ORDER</code>.</li></ul><h4>Fixed
    issues</h4><ul><li>Error message improvement: When retrieving Secret file encrypted
    using corrupted KMS token (CDS-43080)</li><li>UI showing the wrong Rollback Artifact
    details (CDS-42327, ZD-29101, ZD-32440, ZD-33792) Fixed a bug where the Rollback
    was showing the wrong artifact build in the ui only.</li><li>Tags are not getting
    populated on the Deployment Page correctly (CDS-41001, ZD-32937) Tags that were
    getting unresolved after the Approval step remained unresolved. Tags were also
    getting unresolved after resuming an expired Workflow. They now get resolved after
    the stage that they resumed from completes while enabling the Feature Flag <code>MERGE_RUNTIME_VARIABLES_IN_RESUME</code>.</li></ul><p></p><h3>September
    7th, 2022, version 76619</h3><h4>Enhancements for CD</h4><ul><li>Nexus RAW Repository
    type support (CDS-38260, ZD-20638, ZD-30449, ZD-33630). You can now add artifacts
    from Nexus3 raw repository formats in Harness CG. Enable the feature flag <code>NEXUS3_RAW_REPOSITORY</code>for
    this feature, and the raw repository format will be available as an artifact source.</li></ul><h4>Fixed
    Issues for CD</h4><ul><li>Manifest chart collection is failing in PRE-QA for V2
    services (CDS-42581). This issue has been fixed.</li><li>Trigger on last deployed
    artifact is failing to find the artifact - Harness doesn&#39;t account for different
    service if workflow is templatized (CDS-41832, ZD-33449). You can now find the
    artifacts from the last deployed workflow or pipeline with the same service as
    triggered workflow when the feature flag <code>SERVICE_ID_FILTER_FOR_TRIGGERS</code>
    is enabled.</li><li>Terraform plan should be encrypted and not be visible in the
    UI (CDS-41149, ZD-32913). When the feature flag <code>OPTIMIZED_TF_PLAN</code>
    is enabled, the shell script step will not fail for $(terrformPlan.jsonFilePath())
    expression and the value of this expression will be null.</li></ul><h4>Enhancements
    for Harness Platform</h4><ul><li>You can exclude applications when assigning permissions
    to User Groups in Harness. (PL-26819)<br/>See <a href="article/ven0bvulsj-users-and-permissions#exclude_applications">Exclude
    Applications</a>.</li><li>The support for CyberArk secret manager is now deprecated.
    (PL-25423)</li></ul><h3>August 31st, 2022, version 76518</h3><h4>Enhancements</h4><p>N/A</p><h4>Fixed
    Issues for CD</h4><ul><li>Hide &#34;Mark as Success&#34; and &#34;Mark as Failures&#34;
    in UI for CG (CDS-41031).<br/>The &#34;Mark as Success&#34; and &#34;Mark as Failures&#34;
    have been removed from Jenkins running stage.</li><li>Approval Step, Reject Approval
    will execute a Rollback (CDS-40853) (Zendesk Ticket ID 19570).<br/>The Approval
    Step has two buttons: <strong>Reject and Rollback</strong> and <strong>Reject</strong>.
    When you clicked on either button, the Rollback was executed. The <strong>Reject</strong>
    button has been renamed as <strong>Reject and Follow Failure Strategy</strong>.
    When a rejection occurs, it was being processed as an application error and the
    rollback was occuring for the failure strategy. This issue has been fixed.</li><li>Approval
    using Slack is not working in Prod 1 (CDS-42064) (Zendesk Ticket ID 33758).<br/>Slack
    approval was not working in the workflow execution steps for Prod 1 accounts.
    This issue has been fixed.</li><li>Manager taking too much time to assign a task
    (CDS-41999) (Zendesk Ticket ID 33514)<br/>API access type for GitLab connector
    was not being populated. This issue has been fixed.</li><li>Trigger on Last Deployed
    Artifact is Failing to Find Artifact (CDS-41896) (Zendesk Ticket ID 33547)  <br/>Triggered
    pipeline was unable to fetch artifacts from parent pipeline earlier when FF RTIFACT_COLLECTION_CONFIGURABLE
    was enabled . This issue has been fixed.</li><li>Trigger on Last Deployed Artifact
    is Failing to Find Artifact - Harness doesn&#39;t account for different service
    if workflow is templatized (CDS-41832) (Zendesk Ticket ID 33449)<br/>This issue
    has been fixed. You can now find the artifacts from last deployed workflow or
    pipeline with the same service as the triggered workflow by enabling the added
    feature flag.</li><li>Jira approval step was still waiting although Jira status
    was changed to Approve criteria (CDS-41567) (Zendesk Ticket ID 33416).<br/> This
    issue has been fixed.</li></ul><h4>Fixed issues for Harness Platform</h4><ul><li>Token
    renewal for AppRole-based login in the vault happened using a background iterator.<br/>It
    was not recommended to store a token if its TTL is less than the iterator interval.
    (PL-26472)<br/>This has been fixed by removing the AppRole token renewal. Now
    the token is fetched on the fly before any CRUD operation by doing AppRole login
    with <code>secretId</code> and <code>AppRoleId</code>.<br/>This fix is behind
    the feature flag <code>DO_NOT_RENEW_APPROLE_TOKEN</code>.</li></ul><h3>August
    25th, 2022, version 76425</h3><ul><li>Delegate Version: 76420</li></ul><h4>Enhancements</h4><ul><li>Change
    Harness Users per account default limit to 50k users for paid accounts (PL-27300)</li><li>For
    Immutable Delegates, the Harness Manager will receive information about when the
    upgrader was last updated and if autoUpgrade is off/on (DEL-4379)</li><li>Upgrade
    GO in go-template 0.4 to 1.17.9 from 1.16.4 (CDS-41347)<br/>The Harness Delegate
    includes a new binary of go-template (version 0.4.1) For the default Harness Delegates,
    this version works out of the box. For a no-tools Delegate, you need to manually
    download the binary. It&#39;s be available on: https://app.harness.io/public/shared/tools/go-template/release/v0.4.1/bin/linux/amd64/go-template</li><li>Removed
    library nanohttpd. Outdated. Upgraded the azure-identity version from 1.1.2 to
    1.4.4 to remove vulnerabilities (CDS-40796)</li></ul><h4>Fixed issues</h4><ul><li>Not
    able to select encrypted text in environment variable override (PL-27444, ZD-33520)<br/>In
    Variable Overrides, it was not allowed to select of &#34;Type&#34; (&#39;Text&#39;
    or &#39;Encrypted Text&#39;) for single individual services. &#34;Type&#34; Dropdown
    was always disabled for specific services. It only allowed it for &#39;All Services&#39;
    (PL-26345). This happened as a part of implementation of a new, faster component.
    This issue has been resolved. Now users will be able to set VariableOverrides
    even for single individuals services.</li><li>GraphQL User Not Authorized (PL-27092,
    ZD-28969, ZD-30587, ZD-33183, ZD-33347, ZD-33487, ZD-33506)</li><li>Add validation
    for SecretName Prefix (PL-19543)</li><li>Add Encrypted Text for GCP Secret Manager:
    mandatory Version setting needs an asterisk (PL-14239)</li><li>Failure Strategy
    Retry is taking null from 2nd retry for execution input (PIE-4874)<br/>On retry
    we create a new nodeExecution, so the execution input instance was not present
    for the new nodeExecutionId. Fix: While cloning the nodeExecution for retry, we
    are now cloning the execution input instance as well.</li><li>Providing User Group
    at execution time failing (PIE-4810)<br/>It was happening because we were not
    handling arrayNode while converting the merged template yaml to map. Added support
    for the list.</li><li>&#34;Failed to start watcher&#34; error fixed in Delegate
    (DEL-4672)<br/>Modified the Delegate code to download start.sh script every attempt
    to start watcher.</li><li>Automation Test Failure: ECS Copy Download URL contains
    /v3 but no other Delegate has it (DEL-4654)</li><li>CloudFormation Rollback Failure
    (CDS-41919, ZD-33635)</li><li>Tanzu (PCF) tests are failing with the error invalid
    request: artifact URL is required (CDS-41913)<br/>Empty artifact URL an exception
    was being thrown. Removed that exception.</li><li>Remote Terraform Backend Config
    rename labels to Inline and Git Repository (CDS-41890)</li><li>SFTP connector
    creation failing (CDS-41868)<br/>Due to Delegate-side library upgrade, SFTP connector
    test was failing and is now fixed.</li><li>PostgreSQL query throwing hundreds
    of errors on Timescale (single quotes not handled properly) (CDS-41793)</li><li>StateMachine
    Transformation Error (CDS-41652, ZD-33485, ZD-33716)</li><li>500 Error on HTTP
    Request (CDS-41642, ZD-33272, ZD-33898)</li><li>Secret value expression resolved
    in Workflow variable is displayed in plaintext in Pipeline logs (CDS-41544, ZD-33364)<br/>Workflow
    variables that uses secret variables and are referenced in Pipelines are now encrypted.</li><li>NPE/MalFormedUrlException
    when artifact URL incorrect for Tanzu (PCF) deployment (CDS-41357, ZD-32975)<br/>Throw
    exception if the Nexus artifact URL is empty</li><li>Fix migration in CDS-37079
    (CDS-41232)<br/>New fields parent_pipeline_id and created_by_type fields in timescaledb.</li><li>Terraform
    Destroy step is not changing after any change in UI (unchecking &#34;Inherit from
    last successful Terraform Apply&#34;) (CDS-40195, ZD-32538)</li></ul><h3>August
    18, 2022, version 76303</h3><h4>What&#39;s new</h4><ul><li>N/A</li></ul><h4>Early
    Access</h4><ul><li>N/A</li></ul><h4>Enhancements</h4><ul><li>Added native support
    to Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus (SRM-4207)</li><li>Upgrade org.apache.cxf_cxf_core
    to version 3.4.7 (DEL-4575). This issue has been fixed.</li><li>Upgrade org.bouncycastle:bcprov-exte-jdk15on
    to version 1.70 (DEL-4433)</li><li>Users wants to be able to set the Task Count
    to 0 (CDS-39790).<ul><li>You can fill 0 value in ECS deployments&#39; fixed instances
    count. This is implemented with a feature flag <code>FIXED_INSTANCE_ZERO_ALLOW</code>.</li></ul></li><li>Abort/Rollback
    is disabled during a freeze (CDS-38996)<ul><li>Enabled rollback and abort in deployment
    freeze window for pipelines that were running before deployment freeze window
    is activated.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Fixed Issues</h4><ul><li>Delegates are not
    picking up tasks because of redis connection errors (DEL-4617). This issue has
    been fixed.</li><li>Unable to deploy 401 Forbidden/ 403 for accessing Harness
    ConfigMap - delegate start script. Examine the environment variables and automatically
    add the master IP if that env var exists (DEL-3251)<ul><li>Proxy configured for
    a delegate will not work on kubernetes master ip. The delegate cannot access KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST
    without proxy even if proxy has been configured for delegate.</li></ul></li><li>UI
    slowness when editing a hidden variable override (PL-26345)<ul><li>The VariableOverrides
    component was slow to load EncryptedText (secrets) due to fetching a large number
    of them from backend. This issue has been resolved. You should be able to edit
    variables without any noticeable delay and save the overriden variables. This
    feature has the feature flag <code>USE_PAGINATED_ENCRYPT_FOR_VARIABLE_OVERRIDES</code>.</li></ul></li><li>Watcher
    Stackdriver logging not coming up in QA and Prod1 (DEL-4597)<ul><li>Missing dependencies
    were added to the watcher.</li></ul></li><li>Even after setting yaml as POLL_FOR_TASKS
    = true, delegate is coming up with pollForTasks=false (DEL-4571)<ul><li>The config-delegate.yml
    in delegate.sh was being overwritten due to the setting in start. sh not being
    preserved. This issue has has been fixed.</li></ul></li><li>Delegate Download
    URl is incorrect and not working (DEL-4545)<ul><li>This issue has been fixed.</li></ul></li><li>Invalid
    Provisioner Name blocks GitSync (CDS-41464)<ul><li>If the entity name contained
    gitsync from harness to git, gitsync failed without an alert. This issue has been
    fixed.</li></ul></li><li>We shouldn&#39;t print docker label itself as the value
    if the docker label is missing.<ul><li>The artifact label returns null if it is
    not present in the artifact. This issue has been fixed.</li></ul></li><li>Using
    &#34;delegate: ubi-no-tools&#34; does not work for k8s deployments (CDS-41026)<ul><li>If
    you installed only the required tools, Harness attempted to obtain the paths for
    all tools (helm, go-template, kubectl, oc kustomize and this resulted in a failure
    prior to deployment. This issue has been fixed. A default value will be used to
    prevent any failure before starting deployment.</li></ul></li><li>Tags are not
    getting populated on the Deployment Page correctly (CDS-40828)<ul><li>Tags that
    were unresolved after the Approval step do not get unresolved again.</li></ul></li><li>Non-prod
    deployments getting blocked when Freeze window for PROD env is enabled (CDS-40192,
    CDS-40046, CDS-35655, CDS-32525)</li><li>Supplied missing dependences that prevented
    Watcher Stackdriver logging from running. (DEL-4597)</li><li>Resolved a conflict
    that resulted in the overwrite of the <code>config-delegate.yml</code> file and
    interfered with configuration settings in the <code>start.sh</code> script. The
    <code>delegate.sh</code> script was changed to rewrite the correct value for the
    environment variable. (DEL-4571)</li></ul><h3>August 8, 2022, version 76128</h3><ul><li>Delegate
    version: 76128</li></ul><h4>What&#39;s new</h4><ul><li>Approval Step now has <strong>Reject</strong>
    and <strong>Reject and Rollback</strong> buttons (CDS-40853, ZD-19570)<ul><li><strong>Reject</strong>
    initiates the Failure Strategy for the Workflow. By default, any Workflow you
    create has rollback as the default Failure Strategy. But in many cases you will
    have a different Failure Strategy.</li><li><strong>Reject and Rollback</strong>
    rolls back the Workflow regardless of the Workflow Failure Strategy.<figure><img

    style="max-height:50%;max-width:50%" data-hd-height="50%" data-hd-width="50%"/></figure></li></ul></li><li>Azure
    WebApp deployments now support the Basic deployment type (CDS-39316)<ul><li>You
    can now deploy to Azure Web services using Basic workflows. This will allow you
    to deploy to a single slot at a time.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Early access</h4><ul><li>Harness
    will pull images with over 10k tags (CDS-25769, ZD-20358, ZD-21781)<ul><li>Before,
    if you used a large number of tags for images in your repo, Harness had a limitation
    of fetching only 10,000.</li><li>With this change, you can select one of the available
    tags from 10k or more or provide a custom tag. During Workflow execution, Harness
    will fetch the image with the tag and proceed with the deployment. This change
    is behind a feature flag <code>SAVE_ARTIFACT_TO_DB</code>.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Enhancements</h4><ul><li>The
    TAR archive utility is bundled with UBI-based Delegate images (DEL-4518)<ul><li>The
    utility is widely used in customer scripts and shell tasks but is not available
    by default on UBI Minimal images.</li></ul></li><li>Delegates can detect if a
    client tool is available at the <code>$PATH</code> location and use the client
    tool for task execution (DEL-4344)<ul><li>The discovery process checks the following
    locations in the order given; the first located tool is used:<ul><li>Custom paths
    configured through legacy environment variables like <code>KUBECTL_PATH</code></li><li><code>$PATH</code>
    environment variable</li><li>Default tool location (under <code>./client-tools/</code>)</li><li>Download
    the tool to the default tool location (if download is enabled)</li></ul>The discovery
    process for immutable Delegates is limited to checking the following locations
    in the order given:<ul><li><code>$PATH</code> environment variable</li><li>Default
    tool location (under <code>./client-tools/</code>)</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h4>Fixed
    issues</h4><ul><li>Unable to use AWS CloudWatch disk metrics in verification step
    (SRM-11230, ZD-32816)</li><li>Unable to add Stackdriver log verify step as its
    throwing &#34;The caller does not have permission&#34;. Scopes not being honored
    for Stackdriver&#39;s &#34;get-sample-record&#34; in setup (SRM-11087, ZD-32354)</li><li>Git
    Sync request for One File is bringing in Additional Files (PL-27006, ZD-31453)</li><li>Audit
    Trail Returning Invalid Information (PL-26598, ZD-31159)</li><li>Config As Code
    File Explorer displays loading when using search field (PL-26491, ZD-32330)<ul><li>Only
    the apps/files which match the query typed in search bar will be displayed and
    loading is removed if no file present under matching app is there.</li></ul></li><li>Removal
    of certain feature flags from manager configuration results in some still being
    enabled (PL-26379, ZD-31723)</li><li>UI slowness when editing a hidden variable
    override (PL-26345, ZD-32285)<ul><li>The VariableOverrides component was slow
    to load EncryptedText (i.e. secrets) due to fetching a large number of them from
    backend. This issue has been resolved. We replaced the old component with a new
    one and added support for paginated and searchable query for choosing EncryptedText
    field. Now users should be able to edit variables without much delay in the UI
    and save those overridden variables.</li></ul></li><li>Optional Fields on Run
    Pipeline Faces Backend Error (PIE-3687)<ul><li>The timeout field did not fill
    with a default value when it is left empty when a fixed value is not set during
    design time.</li></ul></li><li>Not able to create Trigger for Pipelines with infra
    definition as expression (CDS-40901)<ul><li>Was not able to create triggers when
    infra definition was made as an expression in a pipeline. The dropdown for service
    and environment weren&#39;t populating. Have fixed the same bug.</li></ul></li><li>Kubernetes
    throwing error from Go struct field ObjectMeta.metadata.annotations (CDS-40892)<ul><li>harness.io/skip-versioning
    was by default being generated as a boolean, however we now generate it as type
    String. This change is to ensure support the new kubectl binary. As this is backward
    compatible, we decided to make this change globally.</li></ul></li><li>Fix Azure
    WebbApp basic rollback (CDS-40886)<ul><li>For Azure WebApp basic deployments rollback,
    in case of package artifact type it was picking up pre-last successful deployment&#39;s
    artifact however it should pick-up the last one. This issue has been fixed.</li></ul></li><li>Custom
    webhook triggers must show the collection disabled manifest/artifact sources when
    ‘From push event payload&#39; is selected in actions page (CDS-40884)<ul><li>You
    should be able to see disabled artifacts in push event in custom webhook triggers.</li></ul></li><li>Environment
    Variable resolving to Null value when deployed via pipeline (CDS-40493, ZD-32709,
    ZD-32731, ZD-32737)<ul><li>When Workflow variable value was entered as Environment
    variable expression in deployment modal, it was resolving to null. We added variable
    resolutions before starting the Workflow stage in pipeline. Environment and Service
    variables were not getting resolved correctly in those cases. Added fix to keep
    the expression as it is if it resolves to null during initial resolution. Now
    the environment/service variable gets resolved to the correct value provided in
    environment/service.</li></ul></li><li>Taking a long time to abort an execution
    (CDS-40452, ZD-32666)</li><li>Using &#34;delegate:ubi-no-tools&#34; does not work
    for Kubernetes deployments (CDS-40449, ZD-32497)<ul><li>Some changes were made
    to fail if tool is not installed and when used with no-tools delegate and user
    tried to install only required tools it resulted in failure since current logic
    is to try to get all tools paths (helm, go-template, kubectl, oc, kustomize) before
    starting deployment. Solution is to ignore failure and fall back to default value
    that will be binary name.</li></ul></li><li>Minor issues in Delegate selector
    field in Jenkins step (CDS-40438)</li><li>Javascript Error Trying to add AMI Artifact
    Source (CDS-40416)<ul><li>The feature was facing a empty enum error that was happening
    in certain artifact forms. We have added the empty check for the enum and now
    the tag creation should work fine following the normal flow.</li></ul></li><li>tfPlan
    files are saved/uploaded and not deleted from KMS (CDS-40341, ZD-31827, ZD-32632)<ul><li>If
    new FF is enabled ANALYSE_TF_PLAN_SUMMARY then there are expressions available
    after Terrafrom Plan step:<ul><li>${terraformApply.add}</li><li>${terraformApply.change}</li><li>${terraformApply.destroy}</li></ul></li><li>or
    there are expressions available after Terrafrom Destroy Plan step:<ul><li>${terraformDestroy.add}</li><li>${terraformDestroy.change}</li><li>${terraformDestroy.destroy}</li></ul></li><li>And
    if there are not changes then the Plan will not get uploaded to the configured
    Secret Manager (regardless of the checked export option in the Plan step).</li></ul></li><li>AWS
    Cloud Provider is not being populated in InfraDef (CDS-40271, ZD-31625)<ul><li>The
    change is released under the new FF: EXTRA_LARGE_PAGE_SIZE, which will basically
    increase the max count from 1200 to 3000.</li></ul></li><li>User seeing UI issue
    when loading long deployment filter list (CDS-40182, ZD-32587)</li><li>Terraform
    Apply job is completing successfully but returning an unknown error (CDS-40083,
    ZD-31714)<ul><li>Added warning message in case restricted output names are used
    for Terraform Publish variable names.</li></ul></li><li>Chart manifest collection
    is failing (CDS-40054, ZD-32179)<ul><li>Chart manifest collection step was failing
    during deployment since we were trying to update app version and it was null for
    the customer&#39;s helm chart. Have made a fix to skip updating the database in
    that case. Now manifest collection step succeeds even in that case.</li></ul></li><li>Config-As-Code
    YAML will not generate upon invalid User Group ID (CDS-39770, ZD-32247, ZD-32379)<ul><li>For
    customers facing issues with usergroup in pipeline yamls we have created feature
    flag REMOVE_USERGROUP_CHECK to help them correct yamls from yaml editor.</li></ul></li><li>The
    Deployment Freeze windows are not getting filtered in the audit trails (CDS-39752)<ul><li>Changed
    value from AccountResourceType.GOVERNANCE to AccountResourceType.DEPLOYMENT_FREEZE
    as we were receiving DEPLOYMENT_FREEZE in API call</li></ul></li><li>Check Common
    Parameters for blank inputs and better error logging (WinRM) (CDS-39586, ZD-32289)<ul><li>Added
    fix to throw exception &#34;WinRM Command Parameters cannot be empty. Please remove
    the empty WinRM Command Parameters pairs&#34; when the user tries to submit WinRM
    Command Parameters with both parameter and value as empty. Also to handle those
    empty parameter pairs which are already present now - we will skip them while
    traversing command parameters and thus the code will not throw InvalidArgument
    error.</li></ul></li><li>NPE thrown in Tanzu (PCF) app resize step when app Failed
    to reach steady state (CDS-39556)<ul><li>Showing the failure exception on UI on
    App Resize step failure.</li></ul></li><li>UI is displaying Step as Success but
    the Progress bar is at 50% (CDS-39373, ZD-32113)</li><li>Missing data on CCM dashboard
    (CCM-8233, ZD-32412, ZD-32864)<ul><li>1. Added error and info logs in delegate
    to observe the behaviour in case of any exception.</li><li>2. Added watcher creation
    retry logic to handle the network failure.</li></ul></li><li>Changed the Delegate
    to delete and replace the <code>config-delegate.yml</code> file each time the
    <code>delegate.sh</code> script runs (DEL-4571)<ul><li>This corrected a problem
    with Harness Manager that affected the behavior of Feature Flags.</li></ul></li></ul><p></p><h3>August
    1, 2022, version 76003</h3><ul><li>Delegate version: 76028</li></ul><h4>What&#39;s
    new</h4><ul><li>N/A</li></ul><h4>Early access</h4><ul><li>N/A</li></ul><h4>Enhancements</h4><ul><li>Add
    APIs for Delegates (DEL-3520, ZD-31340)<ul><li>New APIs for listing out Delegates
    needed for automating delegate installation and usage.</li></ul></li><li>Support
    JIRA user assignment fields when using JIRA integration (CDS-28853)<ul><li>You
    can now update/create Jira issues with fields of type &#34;user&#34;.</li><li>For
    details, go to <a href="/article/077hwokrpr-jira-integration">Jira Integration</a>.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Fixed
    issues</h4><ul><li>Python Script failed when using Local validation (PL-26534,
    ZD-32450, ZD-32477, ZD-32501)<ul><li>The Python scripts provided for GraphQL APIs
    at https://github.com/gabrielcerioni/harness_graphql_labs started failing with
    the error &#34;TypeError: Type SecretManagerConfig must define one or more fields&#34;.
    This happened because of a schema issue in the secret managers graphql API. The
    graphql APIs failed for the customer who has enabled the schema validation. This
    issue has been resolved. The graphql APIs are now running successfully.</li></ul></li><li>Not
    able to re-login after logging out (PL-26444, ZD-32400, ZD-32402, ZD-32404)<ul><li>As
    a part of security fixes some SAML library were upgraded which caused SAML to
    break. We reverted back to original version and then added exclusion for velocity
    jar to fix the issue.</li></ul></li><li>Long running Harness Manager task lost
    during Harness upgrade (DEL-4479, ZD-32463)<ul><li>Fixed backward incompatible
    enum change with latest versions of Harness Manager.</li></ul></li><li>Immutable
    Delegate image is installing client tools even for minimal image (DEL-4478)<ul><li>Immutable
    Delegates were still downloading client tools even though disabled explicitly.</li></ul></li><li>Issue
    with no-tools Delegate: trying to download missing binaries on launch (DEL-4475)<ul><li>The
    no-tools images were downloading the tools on the fly. This change stops the tools
    binaries to be downloaded.</li></ul></li><li>Read user is able to download Delegate
    yaml file on customer account (DEL-4425)<ul><li>Harness support user will not
    be able to download a Delegate on customers account.</li></ul></li><li>Getting
    &#34;Something went wrong&#34; when clicking on filter in deployment screen (CDS-39936)<ul><li>Added
    null check for environment so that if no environments present it should not crash
    the deployment filters</li></ul></li><li>Pipeline gives error that infra is required
    when a particular stage is marked as skipped and we save the stage with empty
    value for infra variable (CDS-39825)<ul><li>While adding Infrastructure Definition
    as template in a pipeline stage and choosing the option to &#39;always skip&#39;
    the stage, the deployment was throwing an error message saying infra is invalid.
    We were still validating infra even when stage is marked as &#39;always skipped&#39;
    in which case infra can be empty. Skipped validation of infra in that case to
    fix the bug. Now we will successfully be able to select &#39;skip always&#39;
    option for infra templatized stages too.</li></ul></li><li>Steady State Check
    Step Failure (CDS-39623, ZD-31962)<ul><li>The Steady State Check step is based
    on old Kubernetes implementation (V1) and is not supported. Going forward we can
    display an error message to customers saying this step is no longer supported.</li></ul></li><li>Update
    artifact details from deployment summary while saving instance in database (CDS-39369)</li><li>Execution
    Context tab in Kubernetes deployment not showing expressions (CDS-39150)<ul><li>This
    was caused because we were not tracking context resolution after Delegate task
    response. Going further we will track it.</li></ul></li><li>CF Push does not support
    &#39;process&#39; attributes (CDS-38921, ZD-31747)<ul><li>There were some missing
    attributes like processes and metadata in Tanzu (PCF) manifest because it wasn&#39;t
    being parsed. Have added the supported CF attributes.</li></ul></li><li>UI changes
    for CDS-2992 (CDS-36735)<ul><li>Displayed the service artifact version and enhanced
    the design on hovering over the details.</li></ul></li><li>Workflow Step level
    failure strategy not being honoured when Workflow level strategy is Ignore (CDS-32524)<ul><li>Implemented
    rollback Workflow on step failure strategy behind a Feature Flag ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_STEP_FAILURE_STRATEGIES.</li></ul></li><li>Create
    tags are not displayed in the Audit Trail for Workflow and Infra that have been
    created via cloning (CDS-24569)<ul><li>Added create tags for Workflows that were
    created via cloning.</li></ul></li></ul><p></p><h3>July 18th, 2022, version 75902</h3><h4>What&#39;s
    new</h4><ul><li>Support JAR files for Azure Web App deployments (CDS-39244)<ul><li>Harness

    makes a WebSocket connection to manager for communication regarding Delegate tasks.
    If the WebSocket is closed violently then there existed a race where the Delegate
    wasn&#39;t retrying to make the connection again. This led the Delegate restarting
    after a few minutes. This fixes that race so that Delegate reconnects faster in
    case of network glitch.</li></ul></li><li>User is getting &#34;Unauthorized&#34;

    75805</h3><p>Release Date: July 9th, 2022</p><p>We&#39;re pleased to present Harness
    SaaS Release 75805.</p><h3>General What&#39;s New and Early Access</h3><ul><li><a
    href="https://changelog.harness.io/?categories=fix,improvement,new" target="_blank">New
    features added to Harness</a>.</li><li><a href="https://changelog.harness.io/?categories=early-access"
    target="_blank">Features behind Feature Flags</a> (Early Access).</li></ul><h4>New
    Features and Enhancements</h4><p>The following new features are added to the Harness
    SaaS components:</p><ul><li>User Groups page matches any part of group name. Now
    searching for User Groups can be done by entering any part of the User Group name
    (PL-26074, ZD-30786)</li><li>Added a TTL to Delegate task assignment data. Harness
    stores information on the the tasks assigned and executed by Delegates over a
    period of time. This data was not being expired after a while and was accumulating.
    This change adds an expiry and deletes old records (DEL-4409)</li><li>Implement
    Immutable Delegate Operations Suite (formerly Stackdriver) logging. Immutable
    Delegates now transmit logs to Harness Manager (DEL-4285)</li><li>Improved the
    Deployment Limit Reached error message so customers can easily identify which
    limit have they reached (CDS-38674, ZD-31500)</li><li>Artifactory connection timing
    out. Modified Harness Artifactory UI to accept custom input value (CDS-37077,
    ZD-30437, ZD-30632)</li><li>GraphQL Mutation startExecution can now get the full
    URL for the Pipeline execution as output. You can now fetch &#34;executionUrl&#34;
    on startExecution GraphQL mutations (CDS-36020, ZD-29170)</li><li>Jira user assignment
    fields supported. You can now update/create Jira issues with fields of type &#34;user&#34;
    (CDS-28853)</li><li>Exposing params for the Amazon Default Backoff strategy on
    the Harness Account level. Now you can tune backoff params based on their API
    request rate per AWS account and region already set. Earlier, this was only implemented
    for CloudFormation API Calls. Now, it is implemented for ECS API calls also. It
    is publicly documented here (CDS-23425, ZD-11137)<br/>See <a href="/article/actaxli00u-set-amazon-sdk-backoff-strategy-params-for-cloud-formation">Set
    Amazon SDK Default Backoff Strategy Params for CloudFormation and ECS</a>.</li><li>WinRM
    PowerShell command failure error message improved. There was a mistake in the
    error message. Changed it from &#34;SSH socket connection error&#34; to &#34;WinRM
    Command execution timed out&#34; (CDS-17405, ZD-15253)</li></ul><h4>Issues Fixed</h4><ul><li>Application
    Permissions under User Groups does not load (PL-26111, ZD-32018)</li><li>Missing
    Kryo register for class io.harness.exception.InterruptedRuntimeException.class
    (PL-26018)<br/>Registered the class in kryo.</li><li>Kryo exception in Delegate
    logs with ScmGitFileTaskParams (PL-25981)</li><li>Secrets Management UX gaps (PL-25859)</li><li>Remove
    Slack Channel Name from User Group Notification Settings (PL-25559)<br/>Removed
    the Slack channel name UI element and updated snapshots.</li><li>Sync issue on
    the Git end during Environment rename (PL-25117, ZD-30527)<br/>When renaming an
    entity in Harness, it was intermittently not getting Deleted from Git. This affects
    only those customers who used rename operation with Git sync in the FirstGen.</li><li>Improve
    error message for invalid GraphQL queries instead of &#34;Contact Harness Support&#34;
    (PL-24963, ZD-30093)</li><li>Audit Trail resource lookup capped at 1000 (PL-24548,
    ZD-31159)<br/>Added search and paginated responses using infinite scroll.</li><li>Config-as-Code
    upsert is succeeding but intermittently failing to create objects (PL-23938)<br/>Now
    upsert-entity api will return 400 in case of failure.</li><li>Need to add mailTemplates
    in Delegate JAR (DEL-4403, ZD-31746, ZD-31898, ZD-31917, ZD-31986, ZD-31990)<br/>SMTP
    services sending emails using Delegates were not going due to a regression. This
    change fixes it.</li><li>K8S_COMMAND_TASK does not execute on the Delegate because
    Delegate has 2 min limit to decrypt remote secrets and there are more than 100
    secrets to decrypt (DEL-4399, ZD-32084)<br/>Increased timeout for network calls
    from Delegate as task acquire call is timing out before completion when there
    are more than 100 secrets to decrypt.</li><li>Delegate warning, Delegate received
    unhandled message (DEL-4393)</li><li>Delegate token name is not being saved in
    Delegate collection (DEL-4384)</li><li>Connected-ratio-with-primary not working
    with Delegate rings (DEL-4295)<br/>Fixed the API to accept ringName in case Delegate
    ring is enabled.</li><li>Shell Script Delegate attempting to start on JDK8 (DEL-4291,
    ZD-31673)<br/>We recently moved to JDK 11 from JDK 8 for Delegates. There is a
    check between Harness Manager and Delegate to see if the Delegates are running
    with the right Java version. Under high load the manager sometimes sent the wrong
    version of Java for Delegates to start on which led to Delegate process being
    killed and not able to recover. This fixes the bug.</li><li>Rollout Deployment
    failed due to Delegate disconnected while executing the task (DEL-4167, ZD-30491)<br/>New
    warning in Delegate logs to show if heartbeat is delayed more than 3 minutes.</li><li>Optimize
    Harness Manager to Delegate heartbeat handling to reduce the network calls and
    database updates (DEL-4028)</li><li>Unable to add Rancher as a Cloud connector
    (CDS-39235)<br/>Improved the Error Message for Rancher Cloud Provider Test connection
    failure.</li><li>Service Dashboard not loading details for a specific Service.
    Getting invalid request error (CDS-39230, ZD-32027, ZD-32029, ZD-32115)<br/>Fixed
    &#34;workflow execution not found&#34; exception on service dashboard page</li><li>Only
    listing the last 15 artifacts found on the repo (CDS-39149, ZD-31573)<br/>The
    issue was caused by limit of 500 artifacts and pattern filter. Harness now first
    applies the pattern filter to all artifacts and then limits it to 500.</li><li>Clone
    canary workflow issue (user not authorized, service not found) (CDS-38928, ZD-31616)<br/>Service
    Id and Infra Definition Id are cleared in Workflow phases when Workflow is cloned
    across Application.</li><li>Cannot Fetch Secrets from Harness Secret Manager (CDS-38837,
    ZD-31452)<br/>Fixed Shell Script step authentication on GKE 1.19+. While the response
    from, for instance, kubectl command invoked in a Shell Script step was previously
    &#34;Unauthorized&#34;, now Harness will authenticate correctly if the Cloud Provider
    credentials are valid.</li><li>Artifact text is getting overlapped in UI and impacting
    delete functionality (CDS-38828)<br/>Text will be truncated if its length is more
    than the length of box.</li><li>AWS Cloud Provider is not being populated in InfraDef
    (CDS-38825, ZD-31625)</li><li>Approval Step does not send message &#34;Request
    for Authorization&#34; (CDS-38677, ZD-31302, ZD-32268)<br/>Fixed a bug where big
    artifacts list was not being trimmed down at Slack messages.</li><li>Deleted user
    group reference present in the Pipeline&#39;s user input &#34;userGroupName&#34;
    setting (CDS-38672, ZD-31471)<br/>User Group could have been deleted even when
    they were part of Runtime Input in an execution stage of a Pipeline. Going forward
    the user cannot be deleted if they are present as runtime input in a Pipeline
    stage.</li><li>Terragrunt Destroy Version issue (CDS-38662, ZD-31506)<br/>Now
    you can use Terragrunt Destroy Step even with underlying Terraform version &gt;
    15.0.0. Internally, -force and -auto-approve flag will be used based on underlying
    Terraform version as -force flag is not supported in Terraform version &gt; 15.0.0.</li><li>/opt/harness-delegate
    has many manifest-collection-* folders with empty directories that are created
    constantly (CDS-38543, ZD-30994)<br/>Manifest collection directory is changed
    from /manifest-collection-{app-manifest-id}/ to /manifest-collection/{app-manifest-id}
    to reduce clutter in home folder.</li><li>Auto-rejection popup displayed when
    Workflow should reject automatically (CDS-38525)<br/>While picking previous approvals
    to reject with auto-reject previous approvals feature, only Workflows waiting
    on same Approval step were considered.</li><li>Unable to Select &#34;Fixed&#34;
    Workflow variables when rerunning a Workflow directly (CDS-38270, ZD-31200)<br/>Added
    condition to populate Workflow variables with old values.</li><li>HelmChart AppVersion
    intermittently returns null using Harness variables (CDS-38071, ZD-30735)</li><li>If
    Terraform init fails Terraform Plan task is still trying to read Terraform Plan
    (CDS-37894)<br/>Error handling during Terraform initialization has been improved.</li><li>Failed
    build number in deployment history dashboard when custom Artifactory source is
    used (CDS-37806, ZD-30352)<br/>The deployment status was showing wrong artifact
    in custom deployment type when a rollback happened. Have fixed this to show the
    correct artifact.</li><li>Harness Template issue broke Workflows (CDS-37480, ZD-28531)<br/>YAML
    won&#39;t have Service name and Environment name when templatized.</li><li>Validate
    the costs reported by CCM (CCM-7987, ZD-31791)</li></ul><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Minor

    restarted (CDS-36559, ZD-18501, ZD-29096)<ul><li>We added a monitor to detect
    when a workflow has an active status, is stuck in a not execution step, and for
    more than 45 minutes. The REPEAT, FORK, PHASE_STEP, PHASE, and SUB_WORKFLOW are
    considered not execution steps. This feature is behind FF named WORKFLOW_EXECUTION_ZOMBIE_MONITOR.</li><li>Two

    logging not working for delegate post 753xx. Logging dependency was removed during

    to stop logging to stack driver (DEL-4278)</li><li>Deployment Is not Accessible

    in UI. This fixes them (DEL-4277, ZD-31501, ZD-31622)</li><li>[GraphQL] delegateList

    Date: May 19, 2022</p><p>We&#39;re pleased to present Harness SaaS Release 74602.</p><h3>General
    What&#39;s New and Early Access</h3><ul><li><a href="https://changelog.harness.io/?categories=fix,improvement,new"
    target="_blank">New features added to Harness</a>.</li><li><a href="https://changelog.harness.io/?categories=early-access"
    target="_blank">Features behind Feature Flags</a> (Early Access).</li></ul><h4>New
    Features and Enhancements</h4><p>The following new features are added to the Harness
    SaaS components:</p><ul><li>Remove iterator logging and build first class support
    with opencensus.<ul><li>As part of streamlining our monitoring and reducing the
    cost of logging, all the background jobs metrics are moved from log based metrics
    to opencensus metrics providing us better visibility into our critical paths.
    (DEL-3835)</li></ul></li><li>AWS SDK related delegate changes and integration
    with Task handler (BE-2).<ul><li>For CloudFormation steps, we are going away from
    AWS CloudFormation update() API and moving to AWS CloudFormation Change sets to
    update stacks. This will help customers properly validate CF Templates if there
    are no changes done. This is behind FF and impacts only stack updates. The creation
    of the stack will work as it is working right now. (CDS-37148)</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Issues
    Fixed</h4><ul><li>Vault SSH secret engine E2E tests (PL-25237)</li><li>Test Conn
    fails for existing Ldap connection but functionality works fine and even test
    conn works after password update (PL-25186)</li><li>GCB Triggers call is failing
    with KryoException: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Class is not registered
    (DEL-4050)</li><li>Watcher throwing null pointer exception on DELEGATE_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT.
    Handle null value scenario while reading delegate data. Watcher was into a loop
    of reading delegate data, couldn&#39;t make progress because of this NPE. Fixed
    the code path by making correct assumptions. (DEL-4039)</li><li>delegateScopeList
    API Call not working. Fixing the bug of listing delegate scopes when the environment
    is not provided (DEL-3991, ZD-30462)</li><li>Triggers fail when optional input
    of type allowed values is not passed in the payload. Issue scenario:<ul><li>If
    customer had an optional workflow variable with some allowed values, and the value
    was not provided for that workflow variable in trigger payload, trigger executions
    starting failing with error: Trigger rejected because a passed workflow variable
    was not present in allowed values. What happened: Allowed values validation was
    added in triggers flow where we started checking if variables value is present
    in allowed value list or not. This check started happening for optional workflow
    variables as well whose values were not provided and this broke triggers flow.
    Fix: Changed the validation to only occur when variable value is provided in trigger.<ul><li>(CDS-37510,
    ZD-30760, ZD-30769, ZD-30773, ZD-30777, ZD-30782, ZD-30797, ZD-30798, ZD-30810,

    Window same (CDS-36681)</li><li>Cannot Select all User Groups in Freeze Window.
    We were not supporting selecting all the user group and user had to click one
    my one to select all user group if he wants to notify all. Going forward we can
    select &#34;ALL&#34; option to notify all at once. (CDS-36556, ZD-29926)</li><li>Artifactory
    incorrectly regenerates/reads the artifact path - AWS Lambda (CDS-36045)</li><li>Powershell
    script is not terminated when the shell script step timeouts When the workflow
    is aborted or expired, the running shell script step and all its child processes
    now terminate immediately (CDS-24447, ZD-20817, ZD-29183)</li><li>Perspective
    page is not working in CG. Fixed the perspective list page which was not loading
    on enablement of cost categories (CCM-7609)</li><li>CE Weekly Report was being
    sent out every 30 minutes. It was happening for only 1 customer (CCM-7595, ZD-30545)</li></ul><p></p><h3>Minor

    fetch occurred. (CDS-36728, ZD-30077)</li><li>Status of a workflow in WAITING
    status is returned as RUNNING when using either graphql or rest api. When using
    REST or GraphQL the workflow execution status return a value different of the
    UI. To get the current status value is required to transpose the execution tree

    Features and Enhancements</h4><p>The following new features are added to the Harness
    SaaS components:</p><ul><li>Custom selector API for Delegate NG Token management
    is available now. (DEL-3558, ZD-21717, ZD-27515)<ul><li>See <a href="https://harness.io/docs/api/tag/Delegate-Token-Ng-Resource/">Delegate
    Token NG Source</a>.</li></ul></li><li>Harness can now send key Workflow and Pipeline
    deployment events to a URL endpoint as a JSON payload. This helps in analyzing
    how Workflows and Pipelines are performing, using other tools that consume and
    build dashboards for the events. This feature is now public and not behind the
    Feature Flag<code>FF APP_TELEMETRY</code>. (CDS-35193)<ul><li>See <a href="/article/okinra1xu2-publish-workflow-events-to-an-http-endpoint">Publish
    Workflow Events</a>.</li><li>See <a href="/article/scrsak5124-publish-pipeline-events-to-an-http-endpoint">Publish
    Pipeline Events</a>.</li></ul></li><li>You can now filter out the desired application
    on the <strong>Deployments</strong> page using the search option in the <strong>Application</strong>
    dropdown. (CDS-34070)<ul><li>See <a href="/article/lbiv3zwwm0-filtering-deployments">Filtering

    Fixed</h4><ul><li>When adding query specifications in the <strong>Customize Health
    Source</strong> settings for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Health Source, inconsistent
    records were being fetched. (SRM-9202)</li><li>When pasting the YAML definition
    in a Workflow, the <code>Update failed. Reason: NullPointerException</code> error
    message was thrown without any reason for the failure. (PL-24456, ZD-29097)</li><li>API
    Explorer wasn&#39;t using the<code>API_URL</code>environment variable. A special
    code was removing the “gateway” prefix from the API calls. (PL-24415, ZD-27919,
    ZD-29434)</li><li>Telemetry framework was failing, which resulted in data discrepancy
    between activation rates of the <strong>CD Activation Rate</strong> and the <strong>CD
    Acquisition Funnel</strong>. (PIE-3353)</li><li><code>AddDelegateScope</code>
    output payload wasn&#39;t displayed correctly. (DEL-3757)</li><li>When querying
    the GraphQL API for Delegates, the <strong>lastHeartBeat</strong> field was a
    string instead of an integer. (DEL-3712)</li><li>Error message wasn&#39;t displaying
    the reason why a Delegate task failed. A Delegate task can fail to be assigned
    to a Delegate for various reasons, like incorrect Selectors, or Scope setup. (DEL-3686,
    ZD-28494, ZD-29304)</li><li>GraphQL API had no method to list Delegate Scopes
    for an account. (DEL-2963)</li><li>Error Message &#34;Duplicate State&#34; was
    not displaying &#34;Duplicate Step Name&#34; and was displaying an incomplete
    notification. (CDS-36298, ZD-29769)</li><li>Pipeline Approval Step was throwing
    an error <code>UNKNOWN_ERROR</code>. (CDS-36152, ZD-29557)</li><li>Jira Approval
    was failing with an unclear error message. (CDS-35786, ZD-29259))</li><li>An incorrect
    error message <code>Invalid argument(s): Task has expired</code> was being displayed
    when adding a Jenkins Provider. (CDS-35524, ZD-29044)</li></ul><h3>Minor Release

    was unable to set multiple Custom Thresholds for a single metric to define rules
    that override normal verification behavior. (SRM-3680)</li><li>The Watcher program
    communicates with the Delegate using a local file based channel. A<code>NullPointerException</code>was
    thrown while reading messages from this channel. (DEL-3623)</li><li>Docker Delegate
    installation was failing whenever there was a space in the hostname. (DEL-2597)</li><li>Helm
    version 3.5 and above was not working with Native Helm Services as the URL name
    was changing and<code>force-update</code>flag was not working. (CDS-35667, ZD-29165,
    ZD-29194)</li><li>Some Workflows were not rendering dynamic Infrastructure Definition
    expressions for Terraform. This failure happens for Pipelines with multiple Terraform
    Workflows that use the same Service and Infrastructure Definition expressions.
    (CDS-35486, ZD-28977, ZD-28997, ZD-29166)</li><li> Concurrency issues were occurring
    when multiple processes execute<code>helm repo add, helm repo update, and helm
    repo pull</code>in parallel. (CDS-35483, ZD-27796)</li></ul><h3>Minor Release
    73902</h3><p>Release Date: April 03, 2022</p><p>We&#39;re pleased to present Harness
    SaaS Release 73902.</p><h4>General What&#39;s New and Early Access</h4><ul><li><a

    features added to Harness</a>.</li><li><a href="https://changelog.harness.io/?categories=early-access"
    target="_blank">Features behind Feature Flags</a> (Early Access).</li></ul><h4>New
    Features and Enhancements</h4><p>The following new feature is added to the Harness
    SaaS components:</p><ul><li>The heap size of the Delegate process is being reduced
    from 4GB to 1.5GB. In addition, we are reducing the memory requirement for Kubernetes
    from 8GB to 4GB. Currently, this feature is behind the Feature Flag. Contact <a
    href="mailto:support@harness.io" target="_blank">Harness Support</a> to enable
    the feature. (DEL-3365)</li></ul><h4>Issues Fixed</h4><ul><li>A fallback scenario
    to handle missing Manager version headers has been added in the Verification Service.
    (SRM-9808, ZD-28900)</li><li>The ECS Delegate alerts are not unless all Delegates
    associated with an ECS group become unavailable. (DEL-3565)</li><li>The default
    failure and notification strategies are not added when a Workflow is created via
    Git Sync. Git Sync to Harness was adding notification rules into Workflows. (CDS-35112,
    ZD-28644)</li><li>When a User Group is used in a Workflow Approval Step or a templatized
    User Group variable in a Pipeline stage, deletion of User Groups is blocked. (CDS-34698,
    ZD-28460)</li><li>When configuring Kubernetes Cloud Provider, <code>skipValidation</code>
    now works correctly with Custom Secret Managers. (CDS-34599, ZD-28345)</li><li>PCF
    perpetual tasks that have failed for more than 7 days for any reason will now
    be deleted, and will no longer be executed. (CDS-33630)</li><li>When you linked
    a Shell Script Template to a Workflow and provided instance expressions in template
    variables, it was not getting resolved.<br/><br/>Now we&#39;ll resolve instance
    expressions in Shell Script Template variables. As a result, if you are deploying
    to multiple hosts and <code>$instance.hostName</code> is provided in template
    variables, we will have a separate Shell script execution for each host. (CDS-25446,
    ZD-18302)<ul><li>See <a href="/article/d15of30a2i-harness-variable-availability">Availability
    and Scope of Harness Variables</a>.</li></ul></li><li>If execution failed before the Kubernetes deployment step, the rollback was not skipped.
    (CDS-4025, ZD-15002)</li></ul><h3>Minor Release 73700</h3><p>Release Date: March
    23, 2022</p><p>We&#39;re pleased to present Harness SaaS Release 73700.</p><h4>General
    What&#39;s New and Early Access</h4><ul><li><a href="https://changelog.harness.io/?categories=fix,improvement,new"
    target="_blank">New features added to Harness</a>.</li><li><a href="https://changelog.harness.io/?categories=early-access"
    target="_blank">Features behind Feature Flags</a> (Early Access).</li></ul><h4>New
    Features and Enhancements</h4><p>The following new feature is added to the Harness
    SaaS components:</p><ul><li>Nothing new in this release.</li></ul><h4>Issues Fixed</h4><ul><li>Spotinst
    BG deployments were not properly rolled back in the event of a failure. This resulted
    in Prod and Stage traffic being routed to the incorrect target groups. (CDS-34876,
    ZD-28441)</li><li>If no instances were upsized in a canary phase for ECS deployments,
    we would fail at the Verify Stage. This is now fixed, and users will be able to
    create Verify steps without having to worry about upsize counts. (CDS-34382, ZD-15257)</li><li>Multiple
    entries in the Kubernetes instance dashboard were showing for the same artifact.
    (CDS-34330)</li><li>If the provided Git folder path contained multiple manifests,
    after enabling the Feature Flag <code>SINGLE MANIFEST SUPPORT</code> for the <a
    href="/article/i5jxqsbkt7-upload-local-and-remote-pcf-resource-files#file_folder_path_new_functionality">File/Folder
    Path New Functionality</a>, deployment failed. (CDS-4003, ZD-16272)</li><li>When
    creating <code>ManualClusterDetails</code> for the K8s Cloud Provider using GraphQL,
    the <code>usageScope</code> was missing. (CDS-4000, ZD-15666)</li><li>Gitlab branch
    names had to be encoded when the Feature Flag <code>OPTIMIZED GIT FETCH FILES</code>
    was enabled. You no longer need to encode the branch names. (CDS-2998, ZD-21280)</li><li>When
    uploading Workflow YAML to the Config-as-Code endpoint, a <code>NullPointerException</code>
    was thrown. (CDS-35463, ZD-28775)</li><li>When configuring Git sync for an application,
    the Git connector could not be selected from the UI, but the GraphQL API worked
    as expected. (PL-23599, ZD-28458)</li><li>We polled the most recent data for all
    running executions to update the status and graph. If you had several Pipelines
    running at the same time, and each Pipeline had multiple stages, this was causing
    serious performance issues. The executions API returned a large amount of data.<br/><br/>To
    address this, we removed the child graph and, as a result, the polling API. This
    reduces the number of API hits we make on the CD page while also saving a significant
    amount of memory on the manager side. You can now click on a stage to be redirected
    to the execution details page to view the overall graph. (OPS-6274)</li></ul><h4>Component
