  body: <p>In a <a href="/article/vf4cy95mst-harness-connected-on-premise-setup">Docker
    Connected On-Prem Setup</a>, you can use the scripts described here to stop and
    restart Harness microservices. For example, if one or more boxes (or their Docker
    daemons) restart, you can use the Start Harness script to restart Harness microservices
    on one or all boxes. Here are the steps:</p><ol><li>SSH to the box where Harness
    Ambassador is running.</li><li>Switch to the user that is running Harness Ambassador.</li><li>Change
    directory to the <code>harness-ambassador-scripts</code>folder:<br/><code>cd ~/harness-ambassador-scripts</code></li><li>Execute
    the script you need.<br/><br/>To stop Harness microservices, run:<br/><code>bash
    stop_harness.sh</code><br/><br/>To restart Harness microservices, run: <br/><code>bash
    start_harness.sh</code></li></ol><p></p>
