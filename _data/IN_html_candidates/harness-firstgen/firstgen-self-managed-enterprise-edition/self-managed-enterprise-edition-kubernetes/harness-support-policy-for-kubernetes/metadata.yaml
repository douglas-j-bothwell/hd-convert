  title: Support for Kubernetes Versions
  description: ""
  short_version: ""
  body: <p>This topic describes what Kubernetes versions Harness supports for its
    Harness Self-Managed Enterprise Editions.</p><h3>What Kubernetes Versions Does
    Harness Support?</h3><p>For the list of versions, go to <a href="/article/220d0ojx5y-supported-platforms">Supported
    Platforms and Technologies (FirstGen)</a>. </p><ul><li>Harness will officially
    support 3 previous versions from the last stable release. For example, the current
    most recent stable release is 1.24.3, and so Harness supports 1.23, 1.22, and
    1.21.</li><li>Harness supports any other versions of Kubernetes you are using
    on a best effort basis.</li><li>Harness commits to support new minor versions
    within 3 months of the first stable release. For example, if the stable release
    of 1.19.0 occurs on August 15th, we will support it for compatibility by November
    15th.</li></ul><h3>What Exactly Does it Mean to Support a Kubernetes Version?</h3><p>Harness
    ensures that we do not introduce changes that will break compatibility with that
    version. For example, using a v1.18 feature that will not work in v1.16.</p><p>Installation
    or upgrade pre-flight checks will warn if the Kubernetes version is not currently
    supported.</p><p>If you are running an unsupported Kubernetes version and encounter
    a problem that is related to an incompatibility, you are required to upgrade your
    cluster. Harness will not issue a patch to support older, unsupported Kubernetes
    versions.</p>
