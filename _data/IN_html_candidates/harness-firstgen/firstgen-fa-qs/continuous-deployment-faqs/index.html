For example, you can deploy applications to cloud platforms, VM images and auto scaling groups, CI/CD pipelines, and dynamically build infrastructure.</p><p>Always start with the Quickstarts in <a href="https://docs.harness.io/category/kx4hs8bn38-getting-started">Start Here</a>. These will take you from novice to advanced Harness user in a matter of minutes.</p><p>The following topics will walk you through how Harness implements common deployments according to platforms and scenarios:</p><ul><li> <a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/rd6ghl00va-ami-deployment">​AMI (Amazon Machine Image)</a></li><li> <a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/08whoizbps-ecs-deployments-overview">​AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS)</a></li><li> <a href="https://docs.harness.io/category/3pyb3kmkbs-lambda-deployments">AWS Lambda</a></li><li> <a href="https://docs.harness.io/category/gk062j3isk-azure-deployments">​Azure</a></li><li> <a href="https://docs.harness.io/category/j1q21aler1-build-deploy">CI/CD: Artifact Build and Deploy Pipelines</a></li><li> <a href="https://docs.harness.io/category/btqlctlqsj-google-cloud">Google Cloud</a></li><li> <a href="https://docs.harness.io/category/7gqn6m2t46-helm-deployment">Native Helm</a></li><li> <a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/d485c2vy7e-iis-net-deployment">​IIS (.NET)</a></li><li> <a href="https://docs.harness.io/category/n03qfofd5w-kubernetes-deployments">​Kubernetes</a> (includes Helm, OpenShift, etc)</li><li><a href="#tanzu_application_service_tas">Tanzu Application Service (TAS)</a></li><li> <a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/6pwni5f9el-traditional-deployments-overview">​Traditional Deployments</a></li><li> <a href="https://docs.harness.io/category/29o4taom9v-custom-deployments">Custom Deployments</a></li></ul><p>Also, other key platforms that help you make your CD powerful and efficient:</p><ul><li> <a href="https://docs.harness.io/category/gkm7rtubpk-terraform-category">Terraform</a></li><li> <a href="https://docs.harness.io/category/hupik7gwhc-cloudformation-category">CloudFormation</a></li><li> <a href="https://docs.harness.io/category/2ea2y01kgz-config-as-code">Configuration as Code</a> (work exclusively in YAML and sync with your Git repos)</li><li> <a href="https://docs.harness.io/category/goyudf2aoh-harness-gitops">Harness GitOps</a></li></ul><p>For topics on general CD modeling in Harness, see <a href="https://docs.harness.io/category/ywqzeje187-setup">Model Your CD Pipeline</a>.</p><h4>What is a Service Instance in Harness?</h4><p>Harness licensing is determined by the services you deploy.</p><p>See the <strong>Pricing FAQ</strong> at <a href="https://harness.io/pricing/" target="_blank">Harness Pricing</a>.</p><h4>How often does Harness Sync with my Deployed Service Instances?</h4><p>Harness syncs just after the deployment and then It syncs every 10 minutes.</p><p>You can check the status using the <strong>Instances</strong> section of the <strong>Services</strong> dashboard by hovering over the Environment.</p><p></p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/articles/cegdxcepwi/1625593528990/clean-shot-2021-07-06-at-10-44-54.png"/></figure><p>You can also sync on demand using the Refresh icon. You don&#39;t need to rerun the deployment.</p><h4>What if I add more Service Instance infrastructure outside of Harness?</h4><p>If you increase the Harness-deployed service instance infrastructure outside of Harness, Harness considers this increase part of the service instance infrastructure and licensing is applied.</p><p>See the <strong>Pricing FAQ</strong> at <a href="https://harness.io/pricing/" target="_blank">Harness Pricing</a>.</p><h4>When is a Service Instance removed?</h4><p>If Harness cannot find the service instance infrastructure it deployed, it removes it from the Services dashboard.</p><p>If Harness cannot connect to the service instance infrastructure, it will retry until it determines if the service instance infrastructure is still there.</p><h4>If the instance/pod is in a failed state does it still count towards the service instance count?</h4><p>Harness performs a steady state check during deployment and requires that each instance/pod reach a healthy state.</p><p>A Kubernetes liveness probe failing later would mean the pod is restarted. Harness continues to count it as a service instance.</p><p>A Kubernetes readiness probe failing later would mean traffic is no longer routed to the pods. Harness continues to count pods in that state.</p><p>Harness does not count an instance/pod if it no longer exists. For example, if the replica count is reduced.</p><h4>What deployment strategies can I use?</h4><p>Harness supports all deployment strategies, such as blue/green, rolling, and canary.</p><p>See <a href="/article/325x7awntc-deployment-concepts-and-strategies">Deployment Concepts and Strategies</a>.</p><h4>How do I filter deployments on the Deployments page?</h4><p>You can filter deployments on the the Deployments page according to multiple criteria, and save these filters as a quick way to filter deployments in the future.</p><p>See <a href="/article/lbiv3zwwm0-filtering-deployments">Filtering Deployments</a>.</p><h4>How do I know which Harness Delegates were used in a deployment?</h4><p>Harness displays which Delegate performed a task in the Deployments page. You simply click on a command in a deployment&#39;s graph and select <strong>View Delegate Selection</strong> in its details.</p><p>See <a href="/article/nf19np91sg-view-the-delegates-used-in-a-deployment">View the Delegates Used in a Deployment</a>.</p><h4>Can I export deployment logs?</h4><p>Yes. Large enterprises want to save deployment information to their centralized archives for years to come. Harness includes deployment exports to serve this need.</p><p>Deployment exports give you control over what is stored and audited and allows you to save deployment information in your archives.</p><p>Harness also provides an API for deployment exports, enabling you to extract logs programmatically.</p><p>See <a href="/article/pe7vgjs6sv-export-deployment-logs">Export Deployment Logs</a>.</p><h4>Can I restrict deployments to specific User Groups?</h4><p>Yes. Using Harness RBAC functionality, you can restrict the deployments a User Group may perform to specific Harness Applications and their subordinate Environments.</p><p>Restricting a User Group&#39;s deployments to specific Environments enables you to manage which target infrastructures are impacted by your different teams. For example, you can have Dev environments only impacted by Dev teams, and QA environments only impacted by QA teams.</p><p>See <a href="/article/twlzny81xl-restrict-deployment-access-to-specific-environments">Restrict Deployment Access to Specific Environments</a>.</p><h4>Can I deploy a Workflow to multiple infrastructures at the same time?</h4><p>Yes. Harness lets you deploy a single Workflow to several infrastructures.</p><p>First you template the Infrastructure Definition setting, add the Workflow to a Pipeline, and then select multiple infrastructures when you deploy the Pipeline.</p><p>Next, Harness reruns the same Workflow for each infrastructure, in parallel.</p><p>See <a href="/article/bc65k2imoi-deploy-to-multiple-infrastructures">Deploy a Workflow to Multiple Infrastructures Simultaneously</a>.</p><h4>Can I resume a failed deployment?</h4><p>Yes. You can resume Pipeline deployments that fail during execution.</p><p>Factors like changes to resource access or infrastructure issues can cause deployment failure. In such a scenario, rerunning an entire Pipeline can be costly and also time-consuming.</p><p>Harness provides an option to resume your Pipeline deployment from the first failed stage or any successfully executed stage before that. Fix the error that caused the failure and then resume your deployment. This also helps you avoid rerunning stages, such as Build Workflow that have built and collected an artifact.</p><p>The subsequent stages from where you select to resume your deployment from, get executed. Stages preceding the one you selected are not executed again.</p><p>See <a href="/article/4dvyslwbun-resume-a-pipeline-deployment">Resume Pipeline Deployments</a>.</p><h4>Can I pause all deployments?</h4><p>Yes. You can stop all of your deployments using Harness Deployment Freeze.</p><p>Deployment Freeze is a Harness Governance feature that stops all Harness deployments, including their Triggers. A deployment freeze helps ensure stability during periods of low engineering and support activity, such as holidays, trade shows, or company events.</p><p>See <a href="/article/6vlut5qvlf-freeze-triggers">Pause All Triggers using Deployment Freeze</a>.</p><h3>AWS AMI/ASG</h3><p>For an overview of Harness&#39; support for platforms, methodologies, and related technologies, see <a href="/article/220d0ojx5y-supported-platforms">Supported Platforms and Technologies</a>.</p><h4>What is a Harness AMI/ASG deployment?</h4><p>Harness uses existing Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) and AWS Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs) to deploy new ASGs and instances to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2).</p><p>You can deploy using basic, canary, and blue/green strategies.</p><p>See <a href="/article/wfk9o0tsjb-aws-ami-deployments">AWS AMI Quickstart</a> and <a href="/article/aedsdsw9cm-aws-ami-deployments-overview">AWS AMI Deployments Overview</a>.</p><h4>Are public AMIs supported?</h4><p>No. Harness only supports private AMIs.</p><p>AWS EC2 allows you to share an AMI so that all AWS accounts can launch it. AMIs shared this way are called public AMIs. Harness does not support public AMIs.</p><h4>Can I do traffic shifting with AMI/ASG deployments?</h4><p>Yes. Harness provides two methods:</p><ul><li><strong>Incrementally Shift Traffic</strong> — In this Workflow strategy, you specify a Production Listener and Rule with two Target Groups for the new ASG to use. Next you add multiple <strong>Shift Traffic Weight</strong> steps.<br/>Each Shift Traffic Weight step increments the percentage of traffic that shifts to the Target Group for the new ASG.<br/>Typically, you add Approval steps between each Shift Traffic Weight to verify that the traffic may be increased.</li><li><strong>Instantly Shift Traffic</strong> — In this Workflow strategy, you specify Production and Stage Listener Ports and Rules to use, and then a <strong>Swap Production with Stage</strong> step swaps all traffic from Stage to Production.</li></ul><p>See <a href="/article/vw71c7rxhp-ami-blue-green">AMI Blue/Green Deployment</a>.</p><h4>How does Harness rollback and downsize old ASGs?</h4><p>Harness identifies the ASGs it deploys using the Harness Infrastructure Definition used to deploy it. During deployments, Harness tags the new ASG with an Infrastructure Definition ID.</p><p>It uses that ID to identify the previous ASG version(s), and downsize them.</p><p>See <a href="/article/aedsdsw9cm-aws-ami-deployments-overview#how_does_harness_downsize_old_as_gs">How Does Harness Downsize Old ASGs?</a>.</p><h3>AWS AMI/ASG with Spotinst</h3><p>For an overview of Harness&#39; support for platforms, methodologies, and related technologies, see <a href="/article/220d0ojx5y-supported-platforms">Supported Platforms and Technologies</a>.</p><h4>Do you support Spotinst?</h4><p>Yes. You can configure and execute AMI/ASG deployments—using Blue/Green and Canary strategies—via the Spotinst Elastigroup management platform.</p><p>See <a href="/article/ighbnk6xg6-ami-spotinst-elastigroup-deployments-overview">AMI Spotinst Elastigroup Deployments Overview</a>.</p><h4>Can I do traffic shifting with Spotinst deployments?</h4><p>Yes. There are two Blue/Green deployment options for Spotinst, defined by the traffic-shifting strategy you want to use:</p><ul><li><strong>Incrementally Shift Traffic</strong> — In this Workflow, you specify a Production Listener and Rule with two Target Groups for the new Elastigroup to use. Next you add multiple <strong>Shift Traffic Weight</strong> steps.<br/>Each Shift Traffic Weight step increments the percentage of traffic that shifts to the Target Group for the new Elastigroup.<br/>Typically, you add Approval steps between each Shift Traffic Weight to verify that the traffic may be increased.</li><li><strong>Instantly Shift Traffic</strong> — In this Workflow, you specify Production and Stage Listener Ports and Rules to use, and then a <strong>Swap Production with Stage</strong> step swaps all traffic from Stage to Production.</li></ul><p>See <a href="/article/bkxhdsur2z-ami-elastigroup#blue_green_deployments_overview">Spotinst Blue/Green Deployments Overview</a>.</p><h4>Can I perform verification on Spotinst traffic shifting?</h4><p>Yes, for SpotInst Blue/Green deployments.</p><p>See <a href="/article/e3ww34nu8g-configure-traffic-split-verification">Configure Spotinst Traffic Shift Verification</a>.</p><h3>AWS ECS</h3><p>For an overview of Harness&#39; support for platforms, methodologies, and related technologies, see <a href="/article/220d0ojx5y-supported-platforms">Supported Platforms and Technologies</a>.</p><h4>What is a Harness ECS deployment?</h4><p>Harness deploys applications to an AWS ECS cluster.</p><p>See <a href="/article/j39azkrevm-aws-ecs-deployments">AWS ECS Quickstart</a> and <a href="/article/5z2kw34d7x-aws-ecs-deployments-overview">AWS ECS Deployments Overview</a>.</p><h4>What ECS strategies can I use?</h4><p>Harness supports the following ECS strategies:</p><ul><li>Replica Strategy.</li><li>Daemon Strategy.</li></ul><p>See <a href="/article/riu73ehy2m-ecs-services">ECS Services</a>.</p><h4>What deployment strategies can I use?</h4><p>Harness supports:</p><ul><li>Canary Deployment with Replica Scheduling.</li><li>Basic Deployment with Daemon Scheduling.<ul><li>See <a href="/article/oinivtywnl-ecs-workflows">ECS Workflows</a>.</li></ul></li><li>Blue/Green Workflow.<ul><li>See <a href="/article/7qtpb12dv1-ecs-blue-green-workflows">ECS Blue/Green Workflows</a>.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>What limitations are there on ECS deployments?</h4><p>Harness ECS deployments have the following limits:</p><ul><li>For EC2, the required <code>${DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME}</code> placeholder must be in your task definition. See <a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/oy6sxbgqvc-use-ecs-task-and-service-definitions-in-git-repos#review_task_definition_placeholders">Review: Task Definition Placeholders</a>.</li><li>For Fargate, the required <code>${EXECUTION_ROLE}</code> placeholder must be in your task definition. See <a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/oy6sxbgqvc-use-ecs-task-and-service-definitions-in-git-repos#review_task_definition_placeholders">Review: Task Definition Placeholders</a>.</li><li>You can use remote files for the task definition and the service definitions, or you can use a remote task definition and inline service specification.</li><li>You cannot use an inline task definition and remote service specification.</li><li>Remote files must be in JSON format. See <a href="/article/oy6sxbgqvc-use-ecs-task-and-service-definitions-in-git-repos">Use Remote ECS Task and Service Definitions in Git Repos</a>.</li><li>Remote files must be formatted to meet ECS JSON formatting standards. See <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definition_parameters.html" target="_blank">task definition</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service_definition_parameters.html" target="_blank">service definition</a> parameters from AWS.</li><li>Remote definition files are supported for Git repos only. AWS S3 buckets will be supported in the near future.</li></ul><h4>Can I do traffic shifting with AMI/ASG deployments?</h4><p>Yes. There are two types of ECS Blue/Green deployments in Harness:</p><ul><li><strong>Elastic Load Balancer (Classic, ALB, and NLB)</strong> - Using two Target Groups in the ELB, each with its own listener, traffic between the stage and production environments is swapped each time a new service is deployed and verified.</li></ul><div class="note-callout">Both ALB and Network ELB are supported.</div><ul><li><strong>Route 53</strong> <strong>DNS</strong> - Using a AWS Service Discovery namespace containing two service discovery services, and a Route 53 zone that hosts CNAME (alias) records for each service, Harness swaps traffic between the two service discovery services. The swap is achieved using <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html#routing-policy-weighted" target="_blank">Weighted Routing</a>, where Harness assigns each CNAME record a relative weight that corresponds with how much traffic to send to each resource.</li></ul><p>See <a href="/article/7qtpb12dv1-ecs-blue-green-workflows">ECS Blue/Green Workflows</a>.</p><h4>What ECS networking strategies can I use?</h4><p>Harness supports the following ECS networking features:</p><ul><li>awsvpc Network Mode.</li><li>Service Discovery.</li></ul><p>See <a href="/article/riu73ehy2m-ecs-services">ECS Services</a>.</p><h4>Do Harness support ECS auto scaling?</h4><p>Yes. Auto Scaling adjusts the ECS desired count up or down in response to CloudWatch alarms.</p><p>See <a href="/article/oinivtywnl-ecs-workflows#aws_auto_scaling_with_ecs">AWS Auto Scaling with ECS</a>.</p><h4>Can I use ECS definitions in my repo?</h4><p>Yes. You can use your Git repo for task and/or service definition JSON files. At deployment runtime, Harness will pull these files and use them to create your containers and services.</p><p>This remote definition support enables you to leverage the build tooling and scripts you use currently for updating the definitions in your repos.</p><p>See <a href="/article/oy6sxbgqvc-use-ecs-task-and-service-definitions-in-git-repos">Use Remote ECS Task and Service Definitions in Git Repos</a>.</p><h4>Can I deploy sidecar containers?</h4><p>Yes. You can deploy sidecar containers using a single Harness ECS Service and Workflow.</p><p>In the Harness Service for ECS, in addition to the spec for the Main Container used by Harness, you simply add container specs for however many sidecar containers you need.</p><p>See <a href="/article/2eyw6epug0-deploy-multiple-containers-in-a-single-ecs-workflow">Deploy Multiple ECS Sidecar Containers</a>.</p><h4>Can I run an ECS task?</h4><p>Yes. In addition to deploying tasks as part of your <a href="/article/j39azkrevm-aws-ecs-deployments">standard ECS deployment</a>, you can use the ECS Run Task step to run individual tasks separately as a step in your ECS Workflow.</p><p>The ECS Run Task step is available in all ECS Workflow types.</p><p>See <a href="/article/jr8rhn5bk5-run-an-ecs-task">Run an ECS Task</a>.</p><h3>AWS CloudFormation</h3><p>For an overview of Harness&#39; support for platforms, methodologies, and related technologies, see <a href="/article/220d0ojx5y-supported-platforms">Supported Platforms and Technologies</a>.</p><h4>Does Harness support AWS CloudFormation?</h4><p>Yes. Harness has first-class support for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/" target="_blank">AWS CloudFormation</a> as an infrastructure provisioner.</p><p>You can use CloudFormation in your Workflows to provision the target infrastructure for your deployment on the fly.</p><p>Here is an overview of the process:</p><p></p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/articles/cegdxcepwi/1605035323686/image.png"/></figure><p>See <a href="/article/qj0ems5hmg-cloud-formation-provisioning-with-harness">CloudFormation Provisioning with Harness</a>.</p><h4>Do I need to deploy an application to use CloudFormation?</h4><p>No. You do not need to deploy artifacts via Harness Services to use CloudFormation provisioning in a Workflow.</p><p>You can simply set up a CloudFormation Provisioner and use it in a Workflow to provision infrastructure without deploying any artifact. In Harness documentation, we include artifact deployment as it is the ultimate goal of Continuous Delivery.</p><h4>Are Harness Service Instances counted with CloudFormation provisioning?</h4><p>No. Harness Service Instances (SIs) are not consumed and no additional licensing is required when a Harness Workflow uses CloudFormation to provision resources.</p><p>When Harness deploys artifacts via Harness Services to the provisioned infrastructure in the same Workflow or Pipeline, SIs licensing is consumed.</p><p>See the <strong>Pricing FAQ</strong> at <a href="https://harness.io/pricing/" target="_blank">Harness Pricing</a>.</p><h4>Does Harness support AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) templates?</h4><p>No. Harness CloudFormation integration does not support AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) templates. Only standard <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-whatis-concepts.html#w2ab1b5c15b7">AWS CloudFormation templates</a>.</p><h4>What deployment strategies can I use CloudFormation with?</h4><p>For most deployments, Harness Infrastructure Provisioners are only supported in Canary and Multi-Service types. For AMI/ASG and ECS deployments, Infrastructure Provisioners are also supported in Blue/Green deployments.</p><h3>AWS Lambda</h3><p>For an overview of Harness&#39; support for platforms, methodologies, and related technologies, see <a href="/article/220d0ojx5y-supported-platforms">Supported Platforms and Technologies</a>.</p><h4>What is a Harness Lambda deployment?</h4><p>Harness has first-class support for AWS Lambda deployments, enabling you to deploy your functions without having to worry about compute constraints or complexity.</p><p>Setting up a Lambda deployment is as simple as adding your function zip file, configuring function compute settings, and adding aliases and tags. Harness takes care of the rest of the deployment, making it consistent, reusable, and safe with automatic rollback.</p><p>See <a href="/article/wy1rjh19ej-aws-lambda-deployments">AWS Lambda Quickstart</a> and <a href="/article/96mqftt93v-aws-lambda-deployments-overview">AWS Lambda Deployments Overview</a>.</p><h4>How many Service Instances (SIs) would 1 Lambda function consume in Harness?</h4><p>1 service instance equals 5 serverless functions. There&#39;s no limit on the calls made using those functions.</p><h4>What artifact servers are support for Lambda deployments?</h4><p>Harness supports the following artifact sources with Lambda:</p><ul><li> <a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/qa7lewndxq-add-jenkins-artifact-servers">Jenkins</a></li><li> <a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/nj3p1t7v3x-add-artifactory-servers">Artifactory</a></li><li> <a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/lo9taq0pze-1-delegate-and-connectors-for-lambda">AWS S3</a></li><li> <a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/rdhndux2ab-nexus-artifact-sources">Nexus</a></li><li> <a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/jizsp5tsms-custom-artifact-source">Custom Artifact Source</a></li></ul><h4>Can I monitor my Lambda function deployments?</h4><p>Yes.

If you use a GCB trigger in the Google Cloud Build step, the config file it uses can be either YAML or JSON.</p><h3>Native Helm</h3><p>For an overview of Harness&#39; support for platforms, methodologies, and related technologies, see <a href="/article/220d0ojx5y-supported-platforms">Supported Platforms and Technologies</a>.</p><h4>What is a Harness Native Helm deployment?</h4><p>Harness includes both <a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/7in9z2boh6-kubernetes-quickstart">Kubernetes</a> and <a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/583ojfgg49-helm-deployments-overview">Native Helm</a> deployments, and you can use Helm charts in both. Here&#39;s the difference:</p><ul><li>Harness <a href="/article/pc6qglyp5h-kubernetes-deployments-overview">Kubernetes Deployments</a> allow you to use your own Kubernetes manifests or a Helm chart (remote or local), and Harness executes the Kubernetes API calls to build everything without Helm and Tiller needing to be installed in the target cluster.<br/>Harness Kubernetes deployments also support all deployment strategies (Canary, Blue/Green, Rolling, etc).</li><li>For Harness <a href="/article/ii558ppikj-helm-deployments-overview">Native Helm Deployments</a>, you must always have Helm and Tiller (for Helm v2) running on one pod in your target cluster. Tiller makes the API calls to Kubernetes in these cases. You can perform a Basic or Rolling deployment strategy only (no Canary or Blue Green). For Harness Native Helm v3 deployments, you no longer need Tiller, but you are still limited to Basic or Rolling deployments.<ul><li><strong>Versioning:</strong> Harness Kubernetes deployments version all objects, such as ConfigMaps and Secrets. Native Helm does not.</li><li><strong>Rollback:</strong> Harness Kubernetes deployments will roll back to the last successful version. Native Helm will not. If you did 2 bad Native Helm deployments, the 2nd one will just rollback to the 1st. Harness will roll back to the last <u>successful</u> version.</li></ul></li></ul><p>See <a href="/article/583ojfgg49-helm-deployments-overview">Native Helm Deployments Overview</a>.</p><p>For a quick tutorial on using Helm with a Harness Kubernetes deployment, see the <a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/2aaevhygep-helm-quickstart">Helm Quickstart</a>.</p><h4>What Helm versions does Harness support?</h4><p>Harness supports Helm v2 and v3.</p><p>See <a href="https://harness.io/2020/02/welcome-to-the-harness-family-helm-v3/?wvideo=1adpr2fxl1" target="_blank">Harness Continuous Delivery Supports Helm V3</a>.</p><h4>Can I upgrade my Native Helm deployment from Helm 2 to Helm 3?</h4><p>Yes. When you create your native <a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/ii558ppikj-helm-deployments-overview">Helm deployments</a> in Harness, you can choose to use Helm 2 or <a href="https://helm.sh/blog/helm-3-released/" target="_blank">Helm 3</a>.</p><p>If you have already created native Helm 2 deployments, you can upgrade your deployments to Helm 3.</p><p>See <a href="/article/cqidzwbzaa-upgrade-native-helm-2-deployments-to-helm-3">Upgrade Native Helm 2 Deployments to Helm 3</a>.</p><h4>Can I deploy Helm charts without adding an artifact source to Harness?</h4><p>Yes. Typically, Harness Kubernetes and Native Helm deployments using Helm charts involve adding your artifact (image) to Harness in addition to your chart. The chart refers to the artifact you added to Harness (via its values.yaml). During deployment, Harness deploys the artifact you added to Harness and uses the chart to manage it.</p><p>In addition to this method, you can also simply deploy the Helm chart without adding your artifact to Harness. Instead, the Helm chart identifies the artifact. Harness installs the chart, gets the artifact from the repo, and then installs the artifact. We call this a <em>Helm chart deployment</em>.</p><p>See <a href="/article/p5om530pe0-deploy-a-helm-chart-as-an-artifact">Deploy Helm Charts</a>.</p><h3>IIS (.NET)</h3><p>For an overview of Harness&#39; support for platforms, methodologies, and related technologies, see <a href="/article/220d0ojx5y-supported-platforms">Supported Platforms and Technologies</a>.</p><h4>What is a Harness IIS (.NET) deployment?</h4><p>Harness deploys an IIS Website, Application, and Virtual Directory as separate Harness Services. For all service types, Harness automatically creates the Deployment Specifications, which you can customize.</p><p>For example, the <strong>Deployment Specification</strong> section of the Harness Service is automatically filled with the Install IIS Website template, which pulls the artifact, expands it, creates the Application Pool (AppPool) and creates the website.</p><p></p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/articles/cegdxcepwi/1605047522282/image.png" style="max-height:50%;max-width:50%" data-hd-height="50%" data-hd-width="50%"/></figure><p>Most often, you deploy your Workflows in the following order in a Harness Pipeline:</p><ol><li>IIS Website Workflow.</li><li>IIS Application Workflow.</li><li>IIS Virtual Directory Workflow.</li></ol><p>Harness provides PowerShell and WinRM support to execute Workflows and communicate within the Microsoft ecosystem.</p><p>See the <a href="/article/2oo63r9rwb-iis-net-quickstart">IIS (.NET) Quickstart</a> and <a href="/article/bq9938fbk8-iis-net-deployments-overview">IIS (.NET) Deployments Overview</a>.</p><h4>How do I set up a WinRM on my target hosts?</h4><p>WinRM is a management protocol used by Windows to remotely communicate with another server, in our case, the Harness Delegate.</p><p>\WinRM communicates over HTTP (5985)/HTTPS (5986), and is included in all recent Windows operating systems.</p><p>See:</p><ul><li> <a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/1n0t9vo7e4-1-delegate-and-connectors-for-iis#set_up_win_rm_in_azure">Set Up WinRM in Azure</a></li><li> <a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/1n0t9vo7e4-1-delegate-and-connectors-for-iis#set_up_win_rm_in_aws">Set Up WinRM in AWS</a></li></ul><h4>How do I set up a WinRM connection in Harness?</h4><p>You set up a WinRM connection from Harness to your target hosts using the Harness WinRM Connection settings.</p><p>See <a href="/article/9fqa1vgar7-add-win-rm-connection-credentials">Add WinRM Connection Credentials</a>.</p><h4>How do I create a Pipeline that deploys all my IIS components?</h4><p>Once you have the Harness Services for IIS website, application, and virtual directory, and the Harness Environment for your target infrastructure, you create Harness Workflows to deploy the IIS website, application, and virtual directory Services.</p><p>Once you have Workflows for your IIS website, application, and virtual directory set up, you can create a Harness Pipeline that deploys them in the correct order. For IIS, you must deploy them in the order website, application, and then virtual directory.</p><p>See <a href="/article/z6ls3tgkqc-4-iis-workflows">IIS Workflows and Pipelines</a>.</p><h3>Kubernetes</h3><p>For an overview of Harness&#39; support for platforms, methodologies, and related technologies, see <a href="/article/220d0ojx5y-supported-platforms">Supported Platforms and Technologies</a>.</p><h4>What is a Harness Kubernetes deployment?</h4><p>Harness takes the artifacts and Kubernetes manifests you provide and deploys them to the target Kubernetes cluster.

What about a ConfigMap or a Secret?</h4><p>Only pods. Only pods will consume SI licenses. ConfigMaps and Secrets do not consume SI licenses.</p><p>See the <strong>Pricing FAQ</strong> at <a href="https://harness.io/pricing/" target="_blank">Harness Pricing</a>.</p><h4>How is Harness sure that a pod is a service instance?</h4><p>Harness tracks the workloads it deploys. Harness checks every 10 minutes using the Kubernetes API to see how many pods are currently running for the given workload.</p><h4>If I create a pod using Harness and keep managing it, is it still counted as a service instance?</h4><p>Yes. Sidecar containers within pods (log proxy, service mesh proxy) do not consume SI licenses. Harness licenses by pod, not the number of containers in a pod.</p><p>See the <strong>Pricing FAQ</strong> at <a href="https://harness.io/pricing/" target="_blank">Harness Pricing</a>.</p><h4>Does Harness support OpenShift?</h4><p>Yes. Harness supports <a href="https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.1/applications/deployments/what-deployments-are.html" target="_blank">DeploymentConfig</a>, <a href="https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.0/architecture/core_concepts/routes.html" target="_blank">Route</a>, and <a href="https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.2/architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#image-streams" target="_blank">ImageStream</a> across Canary, Blue Green, and Rolling deployment strategies.

Harness can provision any resource that is supported by a Terraform <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/providers.html" target="_blank">provider or plugin</a>.</p><p>You can use Terraform in your Workflows to provision the target infrastructure for your deployment on the fly.</p><p>Here is an overview of the process:</p><p></p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/articles/cegdxcepwi/1605050321662/image.png"/></figure><p>See <a href="/article/hh52ews03d-terraform-provisioning-with-harness">Terraform Provisioning with Harness</a> and <a href="/article/9pvvgcdbjh-terrform-provisioner">Terraform How-tos</a>.</p><h4>Do I need to deploy an application to use Terraform?</h4><p>You do not need to deploy artifacts via Harness Services to use Terraform provisioning in a Workflow. You can simply set up a Terraform Provisioner and use it in a Workflow to provision infrastructure without deploying any artifact. In Harness documentation, we include artifact deployment as it is the ultimate goal of Continuous Delivery.</p><p>See <a href="/article/jaxppd8w9j-using-the-terraform-apply-command">Using the Terraform Apply Command</a>.</p><h4>Are Harness Service Instances counted with Terraform provisioning?</h4><p>Harness Service Instances (SIs) are not consumed and no additional licensing is required when a Harness Workflow uses Terraform to provision resources. When Harness deploys artifacts via Harness Services to the provisioned infrastructure in the same Workflow or Pipeline, SIs licensing is consumed.</p><p>See the <strong>Pricing FAQ</strong> at <a href="https://harness.io/pricing/" target="_blank">Harness Pricing</a>.</p><h4>What deployment strategies can I use Terraform with?</h4><p>Terraform Infrastructure Provisioners are only supported in Canary and Multi-Service deployment types. For AMI/ASG and ECS deployments, Terraform Infrastructure Provisioners are also supported in Blue/Green deployments.</p><p>The <strong>Terraform Provision</strong> and <strong>Terraform Rollback</strong> commands are available in the <strong>Pre-deployment</strong> section and the <strong>Terraform Destroy</strong> command is available in the <strong>Post-deployment</strong> section.</p><h4>Can I perform a Terraform dry run?</h4><p>Yes. The Terraform Provision and Terraform Apply steps in a Workflow can be executed as a dry run, just like running the <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/plan.html" target="_blank">terraform plan</a> command.</p><p>The dry run will refresh the state file and generate a plan, but not apply the plan. You can then set up an Approval step to follow the dry run, followed by the Terraform Provision or Terraform Apply step to apply the plan.</p><p>See <a href="/article/xthfj92dys-terraform-dry-run">Perform a Terraform Dry Run</a>.</p><h4>Can I remove resources provisioned with Terraform?</h4><p>Yes. You can add a <strong>Terraform Destroy</strong> Workflow step to remove any provisioned infrastructure, just like running the <code>terraform destroy</code> command. See <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/destroy.html" target="_blank">destroy</a> from Terraform.</p><p>See <a href="/article/4egyxnse9r-terraform-destroy">Remove Provisioned Infra with Terraform Destroy</a>.</p><h3>Traditional (SSH)</h3><p>For an overview of Harness&#39; support for platforms, methodologies, and related technologies, see <a href="/article/220d0ojx5y-supported-platforms">Supported Platforms and Technologies</a>.</p><h4>What is a Harness Traditional (SSH) deployment?</h4><p>Traditional deployments involve obtaining an application package from an artifact source, such as a WAR file in an AWS S3 bucket, and deploying it to a target host, such an AWS AMI.</p><p>You can perform traditional deployments to AWS and Azure, and to any server on any platform via a platform agnostic <a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/stkxmb643f-add-physical-data-center-cloud-provider">Physical Data Center</a> connection.

Once you have synched your Harness account or Applications with your Git repo(s), you can view bi-directional activity between Harness and your repos using <strong>Git Sync Activity</strong>.</p><p>Git Sync Activity provides you with a granular, commit-by-commit audit of every change and ensures that you are fully aware of all Git activity with your Harness account and Applications.</p><p>See <a href="/article/zdk5xsdk72-view-harness-git-sync-activity">View Harness Git Sync Activity</a>.</p><h4>Can Harness troubleshoot Git sync errors?</h4><p>Yes. Harness you diagnose errors you might encounter during the Harness Git sync process. For example, when you sync a Harness Application or account with a Git repo, or when you sync an Application or Workflow in Git with Harness.</p><p>See <a href="/article/0ralbeajno-diagnose-git-errors">Diagnose Git Sync Errors</a>.</p><h4>Does Harness support GitOps?</h4><p>Yes. Harness includes many features to help with GitOps.</p><p>See <a href="/article/khbt0yhctx-harness-git-ops">Harness GitOps Overview</a>.</p><p>You can create a Harness Application template you can sync and clone in Git for onboarding new teams.</p><p>Often, teams create an Application template for engineering leads or DevOps engineers. Each team then gets a clone of the Application in Git that they can modify for their purposes.</p><p>Development teams can then deploy consistently without using the Harness UI to create their Applications from scratch. They simply change a few lines of YAML vis scripts and deploy their application.</p><p>See <a href="/article/3av5pc4goc-onboard-teams-using-git-ops">Onboard Teams Using GitOps</a>.</p><h3>Uncommon Deployment Platforms</h3><p>Harness provides deployment support for all of the major artifact, approval, provisioner, and cloud platforms.</p><p>This section describes how Harness provides features for uncommon, custom platforms.</p><p>For an overview of Harness&#39; support for platforms, methodologies, and related technologies, see <a href="/article/220d0ojx5y-supported-platforms">Supported Platforms and Technologies</a>.</p><h4>What is a Harness Custom Deployment?</h4><p>Harness provides deployment support for all of the major platforms.</p><p>In some cases, you might be using a platform that does not have first class support in Harness. For these situations, Harness provides a custom deployment option.</p><p>Custom deployments use shell scripts to connect to target platforms, obtain target host information, and execute deployment steps.</p><p>See <a href="/article/g7m5a380kl-create-a-custom-deployment">Create a Custom Deployment</a>.</p><h4>Does Harness support custom artifact repositories?</h4><p>Yes.

To prevent too many Workflows or Pipelines from being deployed to the same infrastructure at the same time, Harness uses Workflow queuing. See <a href="/article/hui1k7seo1-workflow-queuing">Workflow Queuing</a>.</p><h3>Harness Pipelines</h3><h4>What is a Harness Pipeline?</h4><p>Pipelines define your release process using multiple Workflows and Approvals in sequential and/or parallel stages.</p><p>Pipelines can involve multiple Services, Environments, and Workflows. A Pipeline can be triggered either manually or using <a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/xerirloz9a-add-a-trigger-2">Triggers</a>.</p><p>See <a href="/article/zc1u96u6uj-pipeline-configuration">Create a Pipeline</a>.</p><h4>Can I skip Pipeline stages?</h4><p>Yes. You can use skip conditions to control how Pipeline stages execute.</p><p>For example, you could evaluate a branch name to determine which Stage to run. If the branch name is not <strong>master</strong>, you could skip a Workflow that deploys from the master branch.</p><p>See <a href="/article/6kefu7s7ne-skip-conditions">Pipeline Skip Conditions</a>.</p><h4>Can I create a Pipeline template?</h4><p>Yes. Pipeline templates allow you to use one Pipeline with multiple Services and Infrastructure Definitions and a single Environment.</p><p>You template a Pipeline by replacing these settings with variable expressions. Each time you run the Pipeline, you provide values for these expressions.</p><p>See <a href="/article/60j7391eyy-templatize-pipelines">Create Pipeline Templates</a> and <a href="/article/3av5pc4goc-onboard-teams-using-git-ops">Onboard Teams Using GitOps</a>.</p><h4>Are Pipeline deployments to the same infrastructure queued?</h4><p>Yes.

Infrastructure Provisioners enable Harness Workflows to provision infrastructure on the fly when deploying Services.</p><p>See:</p><ul><li> <a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/9pvvgcdbjh-terrform-provisioner">Terrform Provisioner</a></li><li> <a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/jaxppd8w9j-using-the-terraform-apply-command">Using the Terraform Apply Command</a></li><li> <a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/78g32khjcu-cloud-formation-provisioner">CloudFormation Provisioner</a></li><li> <a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/1m3p7phdqo-shell-script-provisioner">Shell Script Provisioner</a></li></ul><h3>Harness Triggers</h3><h4>What is a Harness Trigger?</h4><p>Triggers automate deployments using a variety of conditions, such as Git events, new artifacts, schedules, and the success of other Pipelines.</p><div class="note-callout">To trigger Workflows and Pipeline using the Harness GraphQL API, see <a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/s3leksekny-trigger-workflow-or-a-pipeline-using-api">Trigger Workflows or Pipelines Using GraphQL API</a>.</div><h4>How can I trigger a deployment?</h4><p>Harness provides multiple methods for triggering deployments.</p><p>See:</p><ul><li> <a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/nihs2y2z61-trigger-a-deployment-on-pipeline-completion">Trigger Deployments when Pipelines Complete</a></li><li> <a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/tb66fmh4iz-trigger-a-deployment-on-a-time-schedule">Schedule Deployments using Triggers</a></li><li> <a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/ys3cvwm5gc-trigger-a-deployment-on-git-event">Trigger Deployments using Git Events</a></li><li> <a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/mc2lxsas4c-trigger-a-deployment-using-c-url">Trigger a Deployment using cURL</a></li><li> <a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/zr4tgwrzlb-trigger-a-deployment-when-a-file-changes">Trigger a Deployment when a File Changes</a></li></ul><h4>Can I pause triggers?</h4><p>Yes. You can stop all of your Harness Triggers from executing deployments using Harness Deployment Freeze.</p><p>Deployment Freeze is a Harness Governance feature that stops all Harness deployments, including their Triggers. A deployment freeze helps ensure stability during periods of low engineering and support activity, such as holidays, trade shows, or company events.</p><p>See <a href="/article/6vlut5qvlf-freeze-triggers">Pause All Triggers using Deployment Freeze</a>.</p><h3>Approvals</h3><p>For an overview of Harness&#39; support for platforms, methodologies, and related technologies, see <a href="/article/220d0ojx5y-supported-platforms">Supported Platforms and Technologies</a>.</p><h4>What is a Harness Approval?</h4><p>Approvals are Workflow or Pipeline steps you can use to approve or reject deployments during execution.</p><h4>What can I use for Approvals?</h4><p> Harness provides the following approval options and integrations:</p><ul><li> <a href="/article/0ajz35u2hy-approvals">Harness UI Approvals</a></li><li> <a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/qxki6o7y31-jira-based-approvals">Jira Approvals</a></li><li> <a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/9nkuhm8moo-service-now-ticketing-system">ServiceNow Approvals</a></li><li> <a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/lf79ixw2ge-shell-script-ticketing-system">Custom Shell Script Approvals</a></li></ul><h3>Harness Variables Expressions</h3><h4>What are Harness Variable Expressions?</h4><p>Harness variable expressions are used to parameterize settings in your Harness components, create environment variables, and create templates that can be used by your team.</p><p>You can create your own variable expressions to pass information through your Pipeline, or use built-in expressions to reference most of the settings and deployment information in Harness.</p><p>See <a href="/article/9dvxcegm90-variables">What is a Harness Variable Expression?</a>.</p><h4>Are there built-in variables?</h4><p>Yes. Harness includes many built-in variables for each platform integration and common deployment components.</p><p>See <a href="/article/aza65y4af6-built-in-variables-list">Built-in Variables List</a>.</p><h4>Where can I use variables?</h4><p>Everywhere. Whenever you have a Harness field that permits variables, begin by typing <code>${</code> and the variables available to that entity are displayed.</p><p>The variables used in Harness follow a naming convention that describes where they can be used. When you select a variable, it helps to understand the naming convention, as there might be numerous variables from which to choose.</p><p>For example, an account-level variable created in <strong>Account Defaults</strong> begins with the namespace <strong>account.defaults</strong> followed by the variable name. The reference for an Account Defaults variable named <strong>productName</strong> is <code>${account.defaults.productName}</code>.</p><p>See <a href="/article/d15of30a2i-harness-variable-availability">Availability and Scope of Harness Variables</a>.</p><h4>Can I pass variables into Workflows and Pipelines?</h4><p>Yes. You can create variables and pass them into a Workflow or Pipeline from a Trigger.</p><p>You can also pass variables between Workflows.</p><p>See <a href="/article/revc37vl0f-passing-variable-into-workflows">Passing Variables into Workflows and Pipelines from Triggers</a> and <a href="/article/gkmgrz9shh-how-to-pass-variables-between-workflows">Pass Variables between Workflows</a>.</p><h4>How can I override variables?</h4><p>You can override a lot of variable values in order to templatize and customize deployment settings.</p><p>These overrides have priority. For example, you can override a Service variable in an Environment and a Workflow.</p><p>See <a href="/article/benvea28uq-variable-override-priority">Variable Override Priority</a>.</p><h4>Can I use JSON and XML in my expressions?</h4><p>Yes. Harness includes JSON and XML functors you can use to select contents from JSON and XML sources. These functors reduce the amount of shell scripting needed to pull JSON and XML information into your Harness Workflow steps.</p><p>See <a href="/article/wfvecw3yod-json-and-xml-functors">JSON and XML Functors</a>.</p><p></p>
