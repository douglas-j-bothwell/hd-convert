    types of access do you need for my AWS master account? </h5><ul><li>CCM doesn&#39;t
    need access to your master account. CCM only needs access to the cost and usage
    report (CUR) stored in your S3 bucket in the master/payer account.<ul><li>If you
    don&#39;t have access to your master account to create a CUR in the S3 bucket,
    contact your IT or security teams to get the required permissions. In doing so,
    we get <code>read-only</code> access to the cost data along with a list of all
    the member (or linked) accounts. CE does not get access to any other privileges. </li><li>If
    you have a consolidated billing setup, this is the only way for CCM to get access
    to your billing data.</li></ul></li><li>If you would like to limit access to specific
    accounts from a cost visibility standpoint, you can deselect specific member accounts
    (or whitelist linked/member accounts). Contact the Harness Support team to whitelist
    or blacklist the accounts for which you want to limit visibility. This functionality
    will be available via UI soon.</li><li>See <a href="/article/5ql31pdjcm-enable-continuous-efficiency-for-aws#step_connect_to_your_aws_master_account">Connect
    to Your AWS Master Account</a>.</li></ul><h5>Can I provide you access to a CUR
    report in my linked account instead? </h5><p>CUR report has data for all the linked
    accounts. It is a limitation on the AWS side to selectively whitelist/blacklist
    accounts in the report. </p><h5>What types of access do you get to my accounts? </h5><p>CCM
    gets <code>read-only</code> access to the cost data along with a list of all the
    member (or linked) accounts. CCM does not get access to any other privileges. </p><h5>Do
    you import the data into your account? </h5><p>The CUR reports are imported into
    our account. CE stores them securely with <code>read-only</code> access. </p><h5>Do
    I need a Harness Delegate to get started with AWS? </h5><p>No. You need Harness
    Delegate only when connecting to a Kubernetes cluster, such as an EKS cluster.</p><h4>GCP</h4><h5>Do
    you import the data into your BigQuery account? </h5><p>Yes. </p><h5>What is the
    typical hierarchy of GCP cost organizations?</h5><p></p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/articles/q8uycdeqvc/1620840065276/mcw-k-5-z-7-ke-7-vs-dqkod-ztv-lqy-df-nj-c-3-zq-s-ls-kugm-1-g-9-o-eoac-gcnel-lgtwbm-ygufid-v-zvh-c-8-fbu-wok-bp-1-elp-hw-m-5-r-okvx-0-qe-t-7-lgf-3-u-xa-son-lrwgkkzu-yl-7-vbh-hxud-t-7-r-2-g"
    style="max-height:80%;max-width:80%" data-hd-height="80%" data-hd-width="80%"/></figure><p></p><h5>Do
    I need a Harness Delegate to get started connecting to GCP? </h5><p>No. You need
    Harness Delegate only when connecting to a Kubernetes cluster, such as GKE.</p><h4>Kubernetes</h4><h5>Do
    I need a Harness Delegate to get started with the Kubernetes cluster? </h5><p>Yes.
    Delegate is necessary for the Kubernetes cluster.</p><p>You can choose to use
    a single Delegate for accessing multiple Kubernetes clusters. See <a href="/article/kuiuc6x257-enable-continuous-efficiency-for-kubernetes">Set
    Up Cost Visibility for Kubernetes Using an Existing Delegate</a>.</p><h5>What
    prerequisites do I need to be aware of? I understand these are part of the installation
    checks you make, but I’d like to be prepared before I begin.</h5><p>Check if you
    have installed the Kubernetes Metrics Server and provided permissions to the Delegate
    to access your cluster.</p><ul><li>If the Delegate is already running in the Kubernetes
    cluster that you want to monitor, see <a href="/article/kuiuc6x257-enable-continuous-efficiency-for-kubernetes">Set
    Up Cost Visibility for Kubernetes Using an Existing Delegate</a>.</li><li>If you
    are connecting your Kubernetes cluster to CE, see <a href="/article/hrdw3foy2r-enable-ce-by-adding-a-delegate">Set
    Up Cost Visibility for Kubernetes</a>.</li></ul><h5>Do I need to ensure the Metrics
    Server is installed for EKS?<strong> </strong></h5><p>Yes. Metrics Server is installed
    by default on GKE and AKS clusters. </p><h5>Do I need 8GB of memory for my Delegate?
    Can I do it with 3GB? </h5><p>You could do with 3GB if you intend to use the Delegate
    just for CE. </p><h3>Azure</h3><h5>Do I need a Harness Delegate to get started
    connecting to Azure? </h5><p>No. You need Harness Delegate only when connecting
    to a Kubernetes cluster, such as AKS.</p><h5 id="undefined">What types of access
    do you get to my accounts?</h5><p>CCM gets only read permissions to the storage
    account in which the billing data export is available.</p><h3>Status</h3><p></p><h5>How
    frequently do you process cost data for the Kubernetes cluster, AWS, and GCP?</h5><ul><li>For
    the Kubernetes cluster, data is processed hourly. It would take between 2-3 hours
    for your data to show up in the Cost Explorer after it is connected. See <a href="/article/4rq26sszja-analyze-cost-trends-across-clusters">Analyze
    Cost for Kubernetes</a>.</li><li>For AWS and GCP it takes about 24 hours for the
    data to be available for viewing and analysis. See <a href="/article/244q2uv4or-analyze-cost-trends-for-aws">Analyze
    Cost for AWS</a> and <a href="/article/oo4vs4exhz-analyze-cost-for-gcp">Analyze
    Cost for GCP</a>.</li></ul><h5>How long do I need to wait before data appears
    for the Kubernetes cluster?</h5><p>It would take between 2-3 hours.</p><h5>How
    long do I need to wait before data appears for AWS? Why?</h5><p>AWS billing data
    is synced once every 24 hours. You will see up to 24 hours delay for data to show
    up for AWS.</p><h5>How long do I need to wait before data appears for GCP? Why?</h5><p>GCP
    billing data is synced once every 24 hours. You will see up to 24 hours delay
    for data to show up for GCP.</p><h5>How often is data processed overall in CCM?<strong> </strong></h5><ul><li>For
    clusters, billing data is generated hourly.</li><li>Recommendations are generated
    daily.</li><li>For AWS and GCP, data is synced daily.</li></ul><h5>Why can’t I
    see my data in the past 2 hours? </h5><p>Kubernetes events are collected continuously.
    The jobs to convert these events to cost data run every hour with 1-hour latency.</p><h5>Why
    is my cluster data showing events last collected since &lt;x days/hours&gt; ago? </h5><p>Delegates
    running in Kubernetes clusters are regularly sending us cluster events as they
    happen. This message indicates the last time an event is received from the cluster.
    This is useful for health information. An event in the last 20 minutes indicates
    a healthy state.</p><h3>Efficiency Score </h3><p></p><h5>Is the efficiency score
    configurable? Why not?</h5><p>Efficiency score is not configurable at the moment.
    The efficiency score objectively represents how well your cluster resources are
    utilized.</p><p>5% buffer of the total cost is allowed while computing the unallocated
    resources and 30% for idle resources. A baseline of 65% is defined for utilized
    resources. So your utilization need not be at the capacity to get a perfect score.
    See <a href="/article/eeekdk75q2-cost-explorer-walkthrough#efficiency_score">Efficiency
    Score</a>.</p><h5>Does the efficiency score take into account overall cloud costs?
    How is it computed?</h5><p>It takes only the cluster resources into account and
    not the overall cloud costs. Efficiency score is derived from the total and idle
    (and or unallocated) spend of your resources. </p><h3>Idle Cost</h3><p></p><h5>What
    specific actions can I take to bring my idle costs down? </h5><p>Idle costs are
    when pods are utilizing more resources than they actually need.</p><ol><li>Identify
    the namespaces/workloads having higher idle costs.</li><li>Drill down into their
    usage.</li><li><a href="/article/ikxjmkqi03-recommendations">Optimize Kubernetes
    cluster costs with resource recommendations</a>.</li></ol><h3>Unallocated Cost</h3><p></p><h5>What
    specific actions can I take to bring my unallocated costs down?<strong> </strong></h5><p>Unallocated
    costs are when a Kubernetes cluster has excessive resources allocated than needed
    by the workloads.</p><ol><li>Check if cluster autoscaler is enabled. If not, please
    talk to Harness and enable it.</li><li>If autoscaler is enabled on GKE it can
    be <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/cluster-autoscaler#autoscaling_profiles">tweaked</a>
    to scale down.</li><li>Look into unallocated costs by nodes. See if there are
    nodes that are disproportionately bigger and causing most of the unallocated cost
    and can be downsized.</li></ol><h3>Recommendations</h3><p></p><h5>Are the recommendations
    configurable?<strong> </strong></h5><p>Currently, not. Harness is working on providing
    this functionality.</p><h5>How do the recommendations compare to Vertical Pod
    Autoscaler (VPA)?</h5><p>The algorithm is similar. Both should provide similar
    recommendations as of now. This might change in the future as the recommendations
    algorithm is modified based on the learnings.</p><h5>What are the key differences
    between burstable and guaranteed? When do I need to apply which? </h5><p>The key
    difference between the burstable and guaranteed recommendations is in the tradeoff
    between predictable performance and cost. If you choose a burstable recommendation,
    more pods can fit on the same node so there is a cost-saving. But if there is
    any resource pressure on the underlying node, there will be throttling or eviction
    to free up resources. If you need more predictable performance, use guaranteed
    recommendations. See <a href="/article/ikxjmkqi03-recommendations">Optimize Kubernetes
    Cluster Costs With Resource Recommendations</a>.</p><h5>Can you automate how it
    is applied? </h5><p>Currently, it cannot be automated.</p><h5>Do you take into
    account the seasonality and trends of my workload data? </h5><p>Seasonality is
    not taken into account in recommendations.</p><h5>What about Horizontal Pod Autoscaler
    (HPA)?</h5><p>HPA on CPU/memory is not recommended along with workload recommendations.
    HPA on other custom metrics is ok.</p><h3>Cost Events</h3><p></p><h5>What types
    of events does CCM handle today?<strong> </strong></h5><ul><li>Changes to well-known
    Kubernetes workload types:<ul><li>Deployment</li><li>StatefulSet</li><li>DaemonSet</li><li>CronJob</li><li>Job</li><li>ReplicaSet</li></ul></li><li>Service
    deployments that were triggered through Harness.</li></ul><h5>How are these relevant
    to help me cut costs? </h5><p>Every event is associated with an estimated cost
    change. By correlating the cost trend graph with the events that occurred at the
    same time, it can be deduced what events might have contributed to a particular
    change in cost trend. See <a href="/article/v7eaaq98vo-perform-root-cause-analysis">Perform
    Root Cost Analysis</a>.</p><h3>Node Optimization</h3><p></p><h5>How can I optimize
    my nodes based on the information I get from CE?</h5><p>You can check the unallocated
    costs for a cluster. If the number is very high, you may consider reducing the
    size of the cluster. See <a href="/article/v7eaaq98vo-perform-root-cause-analysis#option_4_root_cost_analysis_for_nodes">Root
    Cost Analysis for Nodes</a>.</p><h5>Do I get a spot or on-demand recommendations
    today? </h5><p>Not at the moment. They are available out-of-the-box (OOTB) for
    free from the AWS cost explorer.</p><h3>Non-cluster</h3><h4>AWS</h4><h4>Does CCM
    tie cost data back into the savings plan in AWS? </h4><p>No.</p><h5>Does CCM tie
    cost data to make Reserved Instance (RI) recommendations?</h5><p>No. They are
    available OOTB for free from the AWS cost explorer. </p><h5>Does CCM take into
    account my RI purchases and discounts? </h5><p>Yes, the data from your CUR is
    read which is the source of truth on how you are billed monthly. </p><h4>GCP</h4><h5>Does
    CCM take into account Committed Usage Discounts (CUDs), Sustained Use Discounts
    (SUDs)?</h5><p>Yes. Once you connect your GCP account, the data is read from your
    GCP billing API and the discounts are also applied as per your eligibility. The
    true costs with the discounts can be viewed on the Cost Explorer page. See <a
    href="/article/oo4vs4exhz-analyze-cost-for-gcp#step_analyze_discounts">Analyze
    Discounts</a>.</p><h5>Does CCM take into account custom discounts or rewards? </h5><p>Yes,
    if they are part of your billing. </p><h5>What about some services I purchased
    via the marketplace? </h5><p>They show up in the Cost Explorer.</p><h3>Reporting/Scheduling
    and Cost Governance</h3><p></p><h5>Do you support custom reporting to our finance
    teams? </h5><p>Yes. You can get a weekly report or subscribe to your finance team
    or any member in your organization to get a cost report. See <a href="/article/bkmsz6bi79-set-communications">Enable
    Cost Reports Using Email</a> and <a href="/article/5xiwejal3p-set-up-slack-notifications">Set
    Up Slack Notifications</a>.</p><h5>Do you support custom dashboard creation? What
    if I want to share configurable dashboards on a scheduled basis to my business
    users? </h5><p>Yes, you can use Perspectives to create your own customized explorer
    view. See <a href="/article/0yt4i7m7nz-perspectives">Create Cost Perspectives</a>.
    You can add a report sharing schedule to share the custom view with your business
    users. See <a href="/article/nlxsj1coe5-share-report-in-cost-perspectives">Share
    Your Cost Perspective Report</a>.</p><h3>On-premise and Other Clouds</h3><p></p><h5>Does
    CCM support on-prem workloads? What about the other types of infra? OpenShift,
    VMware, etc.?</h5><p>CE supports:</p><ul><li>OpenShift on AWS and GCP</li><li>KOPS-managed
    clusters </li><li>On-prem Kubernetes clusters with custom pricing (manual input)
    and</li><li>Rancher with custom pricing</li></ul><p>See <a href="/article/rr85306lq8-continuous-efficiency-overview#ce_coverage">CE
    Coverage</a> and <a href="/article/rr85306lq8-continuous-efficiency-overview#supported_kubernetes_management_platform">Supported
    Kubernetes Management Platform</a>.</p><h5>Can I manually enter cost data or upload
    a rate card?</h5><p>Yes, but please reach out to Harness as this requires a back-end
    manual entry. This functionality will be available via UI shortly.</p><h5>What
    about other clouds? IBM, Oracle, etc.? Do you support the Kubernetes cluster running
    on these clouds?</h5><p>Kubernetes cluster running on infrastructure outside of
    AWS, GCP, or Azure is not supported.</p><h3>APIs</h3><p></p><h5>Can we export
    CCM data? </h5><p>Data can be exported via Graph QL APIs. You can export data
    using these APIs and combine them with other financial reporting data. See <a
    href="/article/5zxz6rxtne-ce-cost-explorer-apis">Use Cost Explorer APIs</a>.</p><h3>Cost
    Anomaly Detection</h3><h5>Does CCM detects cost spikes and cost drops?</h5><p>Currently,
    only cost spikes are detected. This might change in the future as the algorithm
    learns and improves the prediction.</p><h5>How many days of data does CCM analyze
    to predict the cost anomalies?</h5><p>CCM analyzes 15 to 60 days of data to predict
    the cost.</p><h5>How does cost anomaly detection works?</h5><p>CCM uses <a href="/article/akdd3mxobc-detect-cost-anomalies-with-ce#anomaly_detection_techniques">statistical
    anomaly detection techniques</a> and <a href="https://peerj.com/preprints/3190/">Forecasting
    at scale</a> to determine the cost anomalies. For more information, see <a href="/article/akdd3mxobc-detect-cost-anomalies-with-ce#how_cost_anomaly_detection_works">How
    Cost Anomaly Detection Works?</a>.</p><h5>Can I change the thresholds defined
    in the algorithm?</h5><p>No, you cannot change the defined threshold.</p><h5>Does
    the cost anomaly detection algorithm keep an account of the recurring events (seasonalities)
    that happen on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis?</h5><p>Yes, it keeps an account
    of the seasonalities. However, the algorithm needs to learn these recurring events
    before it accounts for these seasonalities.</p><h5>Does Harness CCM send notifications
    for the cost anomalies?</h5><p>Yes, Harness CCM sends a notification to the configured
    Slack channel. For more information, see <a href="/article/gyesbuez52-set-up-notifications-for-cost-anomalies">Set
    Up Notifications for Cost Anomalies</a>.</p><h3>General</h3><p></p><h5>What is
    the typical hierarchy of AWS/GCP/Azure?</h5><table><tbody><tr><td><p></p></td><td><p><strong>AWS</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>GCP</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Azure</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Hierarchy</p></td><td><p>Linked
