  body: '<p>Harness Cloud Cost Management (CCM) detects cost anomalies for your Kubernetes
    clusters and cloud accounts. Cloud cost anomaly detection can be used as a tool
    to keep cloud costs under control. It also provides alerting capability (email
    and Slack) so that the stakeholders are notified of each anomaly that is detected.</p><p></p><p>In

    Cost Management Overview</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/eeekdk75q2-cost-explorer-walkthrough">Cost
    Explorer Walkthrough</a></li></ul><h3>What is Cost Anomaly Detection?</h3><p>Cost
    anomaly detection points you to what you should be paying attention to to keep
    your cloud costs under control. Whenever there is a significant increase in your
    cloud cost, an alert is triggered. This helps to keep track of potential waste
    and unexpected charges. It also keeps an account of the recurring events (seasonalities)
    that happen on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis.</p><p>CCM cost anomaly compares
    the previous cloud cost spends with the current spending to detect the cost anomalies.
    If the actual cost incurred deviates substantially from the expected cost then
    it can be a potential cost anomaly.</p><h3>How Cost Anomaly Detection Works?</h3><p>CCM
    uses <a href="/article/akdd3mxobc-detect-cost-anomalies-with-ce#anomaly_detection_techniques">statistical
    anomaly detection techniques</a> and <a href="https://peerj.com/preprints/3190/">Forecasting
    at scale</a> to determine the cost anomalies. These methods can detect various
    types of anomalies, such as a one-time cost spike, gradual, or consistent cost
    increases.</p><p>CCM analyzes 15 to 60 days of data to predict the cost. If the
    predicted cost and the actual cost incurred deviates beyond the fixed parameters
    (as described in the anomaly detection techniques), it is marked as the cost anomaly.</p><p>For
    example, you run a compute-intensive job that gets kicked off every Monday morning.
    The algorithm picks up the pattern and updates its model. Based on these learnings
    the predictions are made for what might happen in the future. Anything that does
    not align with these predictions is a potential anomaly.</p><div class="note-callout">The
    anomaly detection techniques are run every 24 hours and the alert is triggered
    for any anomaly that is detected.</div><h4>Anomaly Detection Techniques</h4><p>One
    of the challenges of anomaly detection is reducing the number of false positives
    and noisy alerts. To avoid this, CE uses the following prediction techniques to
    detect the cost anomalies:</p><h5>Absolute Difference Method</h5><p>This method
    takes the absolute difference between the two variables in the dataset. CCM considers
    the actual and predicted cost as two variables. If the difference between the
    actual and predicted costs exceeds $75, then the cost is considered as a potential
    anomaly.</p><p><code>Actual cost - Predicted Cost &gt; $75</code></p><p>For example,
    the actual cost of your cloud resource is $120 and the predicted cost was $25.</p><p>The
    difference between the actual and predicted is $120 - $21 = $99 which is greater
    than the $75 fixed amount.</p><p>Hence, it is a potential cost anomaly.</p><h5>Relative
    Method</h5><p>In this method, if the actual cost is minimum 1.25 times higher
    than the predicted cost, then it is a potential cost anomaly.</p><p><code>Actual
    Cost / Predicted Cost &gt;= 1.25X</code></p><p>For example, the difference between
    the actual and predicted is 120 / 21 = 5.71 which is higher than the fixed 1.25x
    value.</p><p>Hence, it is a potential cost anomaly.</p><h5>Probability Method</h5><p>In
    this method, the algorithm uses a probability of 99% within a range to predict
    the cost.</p><p>For example, the actual cost is predicted to be in the range of
    10-14$ with a 99% probability. Anything that deviates from this range is a potential
    cost anomaly.</p><h3>View Cost Anomalies</h3><p>CCM detects anomalies for the
    following:</p><ul><li><strong>Clusters</strong>: Kubernetes Clusters, Namespaces,
    and Workloads</li><li><strong>AWS</strong>: Service and Account</li><li><strong>GCP</strong>:
    Products, Projects, and SKUs</li></ul><h4 id="undefined">View Cost Anomalies From

    anomalies for your Clusters (Kubernetes Clusters, Namespaces, and Workloads),
