  body: '<p>Harness Cloud Cost Management (CCM) allows you to view your Azure costs
    at a glance, understand what is costing the most, and analyze cost trends. CCM
    displays the data for all your Azure services (Storage account, Virtual machines,
    Containers, and so on) and also helps you get details of:</p><ul><li>Azure cloud
    cost spending trend</li><li>Azure service costing the most in the selected time
    range, for example, Load Balancer</li><li>Primary cost contributor, for example,
    region, service, or resource</li><li>Resources that cost the most in the selected
    time range</li><li>Azure spending by region, for example, US East or US West</li></ul><h3>Before
    You Begin</h3><ul><li><a href="/article/7idbmchsim-set-up-cost-visibility-for-azure">Set
    Up Cost Visibility for Azure</a></li><li><a href="/article/0yt4i7m7nz-perspectives">Create

    Explorer Walkthrough</a></li></ul><h3>Step: Analyze Azure Cost</h3><p>The Cost
    Explorer provides deep insights into your Azure costs. The cost includes all the
    applicable discounts.</p><ol><li>In <strong>Cloud Cost Management</strong>, click <strong>Explorer</strong>,<strong> </strong>and
    then click <strong>Azure</strong> in the top navigation. The Azure services are
    displayed.<figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/articles/wvag8xht5o/1614702113821/screenshot-2021-03-02-at-9-51-26-pm.png"

    can use the following options to <strong>Group By</strong>:</li></ol><ul><li><strong>Azure</strong>:
    Under Azure, you can Group by:<ul><li><strong>Resource group name</strong>: Resource
    group is a container that holds related resources that you want to manage as a
    group. Grouping by resource group name shows the cost of various resource groups
    present in your account.</li><li><strong>Meter category</strong>: This is the
    cost of the meter, for example, Cloud services, Networking, etc.</li><li><strong>Meter
    subcategory</strong>: This is the cost of the subcategory of meter, for example,
    A6 Cloud services, ExpressRoute (IXP), etc.</li><li><strong>Resource GUID</strong>:
    The cost of your Resource GUIDs. The Resource GUID is a unique alphanumeric string
    that represents each resource for programming purposes.</li><li><strong>Meter</strong>:
    Cost of the resources&#39; usage.  The meters track the resources&#39; usage and
    generate a usage record that is used to calculate your bill. For example, you
    provision a virtual machine in Azure. Some meters that track its usage include:
    Compute Hours, IP Address Hours, Data Transfer In, Data Transfer Out, Standard
    Managed Disk, Standard Managed Disk Operations, Standard IO-Disk, Standard IO-Block
    Blob Read, Standard IO-Block Blob Write, Standard IO-Block Blob Delete.</li><li><strong>Resource
    type</strong>: The cost of resource instances.</li><li><strong>Service name</strong>:
    Cost of Azure service, for example, Virtual Machines, Azure App Service, Azure
    DNS, etc.</li><li><strong>Service tier</strong>: This is the cost of Azure services
    having service tiers. For example, VMs, Dv3, and Dsv3.</li><li>If your Azure billing
    export contains the Azure usage and charges information, then the following details
    are listed:<ul><li><strong>Subscription name</strong>: Name of the subscription.</li><li><strong>Publisher
    name</strong>: Publisher for Marketplace services. </li><li><strong>Publisher
    type</strong>: Type of publisher. Break down Microsoft/Azure, Marketplace, and
    AWS costs.</li><li><strong>Reservation ID</strong>: Unique identifier for the
    purchased reservation instance. Azure Reservations help you save money by committing
    to one-year or three-year plans for multiple products. Committing allows you to
    get a discount on the resources you use. See <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/reservations/manage-reserved-vm-instance">Manage
    Reservations for Azure resources</a>.</li><li><strong>Reservation name</strong>:
    Name of the purchased reservation instance.</li><li><strong>Frequency</strong>:
    Indicates whether a charge is expected to repeat. Charges can either happen once
    (OneTime), repeat on a monthly or yearly basis (Recurring), or be based on usage
    (UsageBased).</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Region</strong>: Each Azure
    region you are currently running services in.</li><li><strong>Product</strong>:
    Each of your active products with their cloud costs.</li><li><strong>Label</strong>:
    Each label that you assign to your Azure resources. You can select a label name
    to get further granular details of your label.</li></ul><h4 id="undefined">Option:
