<p>This topic helps you diagnose errors you might encounter during the Harness Git sync process. For example, when you sync a Harness Application or account with a Git repo, or when you sync an Application or Workflow in Git with Harness.</p><div class="note-callout">For information on viewing Git sync activity, see <a href="/article/zdk5xsdk72-view-harness-git-sync-activity">View Harness Git Sync Activity</a>.</div><p>In this topic:</p><ul><li> <a href="#git_sync">Git Sync</a></li><li> <a href="#review_error_categories">Review: Error Categories</a></li><li> <a href="#step_diagnose_git_to_harness_sync_errors">Step: Diagnose Git to Harness Sync Errors</a></li><li> <a href="#step_diagnose_harness_to_git_sync_errors">Step: Diagnose Harness to Git Sync Errors</a></li><li> <a href="#step_diagnose_connectivity_issues">Step: Diagnose Connectivity Issues</a></li><li> <a href="#review_rbac_with_diagnose_git_sync_errors">Review: RBAC with Diagnose Git Sync Errors</a></li><li> <a href="#files_unavailable_error">Files Unavailable Error</a></li><li> <a href="#git_symbolic_link_errors">Git Symbolic Link Errors</a></li><li> <a href="#see_also">See Also</a></li></ul><h3>Git Sync</h3><p>Harness enables you to use YAML for all your account and Application components and sync it with a Git repo. Errors can occur during the Git sync process. Harness captures and displays the errors to help you fix them. For more information on how Git sync works, refer <a href="/article/htvzryeqjw-configuration-as-code">Configuration as Code</a>.</p><h3>Review: Error Categories</h3><p>The different error categories are:</p><ul><li>Git to Harness Sync Errors</li><li>Harness to Git Sync Errors</li><li>Connectivity Issues</li></ul><p>These error messages disappear from the list when the error in that file is resolved.</p><h4>Git to Harness Sync Errors</h4><p>You can find all the errors that you might run into while syncing your Git repo with Harness account under this category. Here are some of the possible reasons for Git to Harness errors:</p><ul><li>Backend receives syntactically or semantically wrong input in the YAML file.</li><li>Harness is not able to find the dependent entity. For example, when you add a Workflow and Harness is not able to find the Service on which the Workflow depends.</li><li>The name of a YAML file changed (for example, a Cloud Provider name) and it is referenced in more than one file. If all the referenced files are not found it will lead to an error.</li></ul><p>To fix the error, try one of the following:</p><ul><li>Fix the YAML content in Git and commit.</li><li>Make the changes in the Harness Manager UI.</li></ul><h4>Harness to Git Sync Errors</h4><p>You can find all the errors that you encounter while syncing your Harness account with your Git repo under this category. These errors occur while syncing Harness YAML with your Git repo for an entity.</p><p>To fix the error, try one of the following:</p><ul><li>Make the entity change from the Harness Manager UI.</li><li>Fix from Git.</li></ul><h4>Connectivity Issues</h4><p>All connection or network-related errors that occur during the Git Sync process appear under this category. Connectivity issues might occur because of the following reasons:</p><ul><li>Harness Delegate cannot connect to the Git because of credential issues.</li><li>Connectivity issues between the Harness Delegate and Git repo.</li></ul><h3>Step: Diagnose Git to Harness Sync Errors</h3><ol><li>Click <strong>Setup</strong>, and then click <strong>Configuration As Code</strong>.</li><li>In the <strong>Errors</strong> tab, click <strong>Git → Harness</strong>.</li><li>Errors are listed based on commit IDs or file names.</li></ol><ul><li>Select the <strong>Commits</strong> tab to list errors by commit IDs.</li><li>Select the <strong>Files</strong> tab to list errors by file name.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/articles/0ralbeajno/1588787870940/screenshot-2020-05-06-at-11-06-36-pm.png"/></figure><ol><li style="counter-increment:li 3" start="4">Filter errors for a specific repository.

It follows standard Harness RBAC as described in  <a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/ven0bvulsj-users-and-permissions">Managing Users and Groups (RBAC)</a>.</p><p>Here are a few things to consider:</p><ul><li>If your User Group does not have permission to read a specific Application, then you will not be able to view the errors for that Application.</li><li>Even if a Harness User Group has Read permissions on only one Application, its users can still read account-level settings. They simply cannot change them. Consequently, in Diagnose Git Sync Errors, the user can view account-level Git errors using <strong>Setup</strong>.</li><li>The activity and errors of all account-level files are visible to all users, but a user can only see the content (<strong>View Content</strong>) of the files for which his User Group has permission.</li></ul><h3>Files Unavailable Error</h3><p>The <code>Files Unavailable Error</code> error can occur when Harness is unable to obtain information about files getting processed as a part of the commit during Git sync.</p><p>Had the Git sync been successful, you would have received information such as how many files were processed from the commit, how many of them were successfully processed, how many of them failed during processing, and how many of them got skipped during processing.</p><h3>Git Symbolic Link Errors</h3><p>If your Git files use symlinks and a symlink cannot resolve to its reference, the Git sync will fail.</p><p>Ensure that you have no broken, or <em>dangling</em>, symlinks.</p><h3>See Also</h3><ul><li> <a href="/article/zdk5xsdk72-view-harness-git-sync-activity">View Harness Git Sync Activity</a></li></ul><p></p>
