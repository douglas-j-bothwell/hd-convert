<p>This topic contains general troubleshooting information for error messages and other issues that can arise.</p><div class="note-callout">If you cannot find a resolution, please contact <a href="mailto:support@harness.io">Harness Support</a> or <a href="https://community.harness.io/" target="_blank">Harness Community Forum</a>.</div><h3>Login Issues</h3><p>The following issues can occur when logging into Harness.</p><h4>Logged Out Automatically</h4><p>You are logged out of your Harness Manager session automatically, forcing you to log back in.</p><div class="note-callout">If you log out of Harness Manager in one browser tab, Harness might log you out of all tabs.</div><p>Typically, the solution is to clear local storage.</p><h5>Troubleshooting Steps</h5><ol><li>Log out of the Harness Manager from all Chrome tabs. (Harness only supports the Chrome desktop browser.)</li><li>Clear Chrome Local Storage for <code>app.harness.io</code> in <strong>chrome://settings/siteData</strong>.</li><li>Open a new tab and log into the Harness Manager.</li></ol><p>You should not be logged out anymore.</p><h5>Notes</h5><ul><li>Chrome <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/storage/sessionstorage" target="_blank">Session Storage</a> is used by the Harness Manager. If you close all the tabs running the Harness Manager and then open a new tab running Harness Manager, you will likely need to log in again.</li><li>A Chrome session will timeout after 5 minutes, but a session timeout can also happen if the tab running Harness Manager is idle for 24 hours. However, as long as the tab is not closed, Harness Manager will continue keep polling to check if a refresh is needed for the token. For example, if you have kept the tab open for 3 days, you might still be logged in, as long as the workstation has not been turned off or entered sleep mode preventing the refresh.</li></ul><h3>Delegate Issues</h3><p>The Harness Delegate runs as a service in your target deployment environment, on a host, a pod, a container, or as a task. It makes outbound HTTPS connections over port 443 and uses the credentials you provide in Harness connections such as Cloud Providers and Artifact Servers to run remote SSH and API calls.</p><p>Most Delegate issues arise from network connectivity where the Delegate is unable to connect to a Cloud Provider, Artifact Server, etc, because of network issues like port changes and proxy settings.</p><p>Some issues arise from invalid credentials due to expiry or access issues resulting from missing policies or cross project requirements in a cloud vendor.</p><p>The simplest way to detect if an issue is caused by Delegate connectivity is to run a cURL command on the Delegate host/pod and see if it works. If it does, the next step is to look at the credentials.</p><p>The following sections provide solutions to Delegate issues.</p><h4>Failed to assign any Delegate to perpetual task</h4><p>Harness does many background operations on a regular basis, such as collecting information about your cluster and deployed software. This ensures that the number of instances we report is correct, among other information.</p><p>This error message is related to these background operations. Subsequent, scheduled attempts typically clears these messages.</p><p>If these errors clear, typically a local or remote networking or similar issue is the cause.</p><h4>Duplicate Output in Deployment Logs</h4><p>This is a symptom of running duplicate Delegates. We call this the double Delegate problem.</p><p>If two Harness Delegates with the same name are running in different clusters, they will show up as one Delegate in the Harness Manager. This will make it seem as though only one Delegate is running.</p><p>Do not run Delegates with the same name in different clusters. Replace one of the Delegates and the issue will go away.</p><p>You might see errors such as <code>IllegalArgumentException</code> and multiple <code>Initializing</code> and <code>Rendering</code> lines:</p><pre>Initializing..<br/><br/>Rendering manifest files using go template<br/>Only manifest files with [.yaml] or [.yml] extension will be processed<br/><br/>Initializing..<br/><br/>Rendering manifest files using go template<br/><br/>Only manifest files with [.yaml] or [.yml] extension will be processed<br/><br/> IllegalArgumentException: Custom Resource Definition Optional[destinationrules.networking.istio.io] is not found in cluster https://0.00.0.1:443/<br/><br/>Failed.</pre><p></p><h4>Running Multiple Delegates on the Same Host</h4><p>If deployment entities, such as ECS services, are getting added and removed in the same deployment, you might have two Delegates running on the same host.</p><p>Do not run multiple Delegates on the same host/pod/container. This will result in the Delegates overwriting each other&#39;s tasks.</p><h4>Delegate Setup</h4><p>Most often, Delegate errors are the result of Delegate setup issues. Ensure you are familiar with how the Delegate and Harness Manager work together. See <a href="/article/h9tkwmkrm7-delegate-installation">Delegate Installation and Management</a>.</p><p>Another common issue is the SSH key used by the Delegate to deploy to a target host is incorrect. This can happen if the SSH key in <a href="/article/au38zpufhr-secret-management">Harness Secrets Management</a> was set up incorrectly, or if it is not the correct key for the target host, or the target host is not set up to allow SSH connections.</p><p>The Delegate is monitored locally using its Watcher component. The Watcher component has a watcher.log file that can provide Delete version information for troubleshooting.</p><h4>Delegate Connection Failures To Harness Manager</h4><p>If the Delegate cannot connect to the Harness Manager, try the following:</p><ol><li>Use <strong>ping</strong> on the Delegate host to test if response times for <strong>app.harness.io</strong> or another URL are reasonable and consistent.</li><li>Use <strong>traceroute</strong> on <strong>app.harness.io</strong> to check the network route.</li><li>Use <strong>nslookup</strong> to confirm that DNS resolution is working for <strong>app.harness.io</strong>.</li><li>Connect using the IP address for <strong>app.harness.io</strong> (get the IP address using nslookup), for example: <code>http://35.23.123.321/#/login</code>.</li><li>Flush the client&#39;s DNS cache<ol><li>Windows: <code>ipconfig /flushdns</code></li><li>Mac/Linux: <code>sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder;sudo killall mDNSResponderHelper;sudo dscacheutil -flushcache</code></li></ol></li><li>Check for local network issues, such as proxy errors or NAT license limits.</li><li>For some cloud platforms, like AWS EC2, ensure that security groups allow outbound traffic on HTTPS 443.</li><li>Try a different workstation or a smartphone to confirm the connection issue is not local to a single host.</li></ol><h4>Delegate Successes Followed By Failures</h4><p>If you have incorrectly used the same Kubernetes Delegate YAML file for multiple Delegates, you will see Delegate successes followed by failures in the Delegate logs. This sequence is the result of one Delegate succeeding in its operation and the same operation failing with the second Delegate.</p><p>To avoid any Delegate conflicts, always use a new Kubernetes Delegate YAML download for each Delegate you install, and a unique name. For Kubernetes Delegates, you can increase the number of replicas run using a single Delegate download YAML file (change the <code>replicas</code> setting in the file), but to run multiple Delegates, use a new Delegate download from Harness for each Delegate.</p><h4>No Delegates Could Reach The Resource</h4><p>This error means that no Delegate could meet the URL criteria for validation. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/migeq3achl-harness-delegate-faqs#how_does_harness_manager_identify_delegates">How Does Harness Manager Identify Delegates?</a>.</p><h4>WARNING: ulimit -n is too low (1024)</h4><p>In Linux, you can change the maximum amount of open files allowed. You modify this number using the <code>ulimit</code> command. It grants you the ability to control the resources available for the shell or process started by it.</p><p>The Harness Shell Script Delegate requires a minimum of 10000. By default, most Linux virtual machines will have 1024.</p><p>To increase the ulimit, do the following:</p><ol><li>Open an SSH session into your Linux virtual machine.</li><li>Open the limits configuration file as a root user:<br/><br/><code>$ sudo nano /etc/security/limits.conf</code></li><li>Add the following settings:<br/><br/><code>* soft nofile 10000 * hard nofile 10000 root soft nofile 10000 root hard nofile 10000</code><br/>You can also set the limit for a user named <code>fred</code> like this:<br/><br/><code>fred soft nofile 10000</code><br/><code>fred hard nofile 10000</code></li><li>Save the limits configuration file (Ctrl+x).</li><li>Log out and back into the SSH session.</li><li>View the ulimit:<br/><br/><code>$ ulimit -n</code><br/><code>10000</code></li><li>You may now navigate to the Shell Script Delegate folder and run the Delegate without encountering the ulimit error.</li></ol><p>If you are simply testing a Delegate on your local Mac, use the following commands to display and raise the ulimit:</p><p><code>$ launchctl limit maxfiles</code></p><p><code>$ sudo launchctl limit maxfiles 65536 200000</code></p><h4>Google Cloud Platform: Cluster has unschedulable pods</h4><p>If you do not have enough space available in your Kubernetes cluster, you might receive the following error:</p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/articles/h9tkwmkrm7/1542232002879/image.png" style="max-height:50%;max-width:50%" data-hd-height="50%" data-hd-width="50%"/></figure><h5>Cause</h5><p>Depending on the size of your cluster, without Autoscaling enabled or enough space, your cluster cannot run the delegate.</p><h5>Solution</h5><p>Add more space or turn on Autoscaling, wait for the cluster to restart, reconnect to the cluster, and then rerun the command:</p><p><code>$ kubectl apply -f harness-delegate.yaml</code></p><p>For more information, see <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/scaling-apps#autoscaling_deployments" target="_blank">Autoscaling Deployments</a> from Google.</p><h4>Deleting a Kubernetes Delegate</h4><p>In the case where you have to delete a Harness Delegate from your Kubernetes cluster, you can delete the StatefulSet for the Delegate. Once created, the StatefulSet ensures that the desired number of pods are running and available at all times. Deleting the pod without deleting the StatefulSet will result in the pod being recreated.</p><p>For example, if you have the Delegate pod name <code>mydelegate-vutpmk-0</code>, you can delete the StatefulSet with the following command:</p><p><code>$ kubectl delete statefulset -n harness-delegate mydelegate-vutpmk</code></p><p>Note that the <code>-0</code> suffix in the pod name is removed for the StatefulSet name.</p><h4>Self Destruct Sequence Initiated</h4><p>This very rare error can be noticed in Delegate logs:</p><pre class="hljs nohighlight">Sending heartbeat...<br/><br/>Delegate 0000 received heartbeat response 0s after sending. 26s since last response.<br/><br/>Self destruct sequence initiated...</pre><h5>Cause</h5><p>Delegate self-destructing because are two Delegates with same name, probably deployed to two different clusters.</p><h5>Solution</h5><p>Remove one Delegate. Typically, one Delegate is in the wrong cluster. Remove that Delegate.</p><h4>Need to Use Long Polling for Delegate Connection to Harness Manager</h4><p>By default, the Harness Delegate connects to the Harness Manager over a TLS-backed WebSocket connection, sometimes called a Secure WebSocket connection, using the <code>wss://</code> scheme ( <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-11.1.2">RFC 6455</a>). Some network intermediaries, such as transparent proxy servers and firewalls that are unaware of WebSocket, might drop the WebSocket connection. To avoid this uncommon error, you can instruct the Delegate to use long polling.</p><p>To set up the Delegate to use long polling, you use the Delegate YAML file.</p><p>For a Kubernetes Delegate, you can set the <code>POLL_FOR_TASKS</code> setting to <code>true</code> in the <strong>harness-delegate.yaml</strong> file:</p><pre>...<br/>        env:<br/>        ...<br/>        - name: POLL_FOR_TASKS<br/>          value: &#34;true&#34;<br/>...</pre><p>For the Shell Script Delegate, edit the <code>pollForTasks</code> setting to <code>true</code> in the <strong>config-delegate.yml</strong> file:</p><pre>pollForTasks: true</pre><p>For the Docker Delegate, edit the <code>POLL_FOR_TASKS</code> setting to <code>true</code> in the <strong>config-delegate.yml</strong> file:</p><pre>-e POLL_FOR_TASKS=true \</pre><p>For the ECS Delegate, edit the <code>POLL_FOR_TASKS</code> setting in the <strong>ecs-task-spec.json</strong> file:</p><pre>{<br/> &#34;name&#34;: &#34;POLL_FOR_TASKS&#34;,<br/> &#34;value&#34;: &#34;true&#34;<br/>},</pre><p></p><h4>KubernetesClientException: Operation: [list] for kind: [Deployment] with name: [null] in namespace: [default] failed</h4><p>If you have a proxy set up on the network where the Harness Kubernetes Delegate is running, you need to add the cluster master hostname or IP in the Delegate harness-delegate.yaml <code>NO_PROXY</code> list.</p><p>For example, you might see a log error like this:</p><pre>io.fabric8.kubernetes.client.KubernetesClientException: Operation: [list]  for kind: [Deployment]  with name: [null]  in namespace: [default]  failed.</pre><ol><li>Obtain the cluster master hostname or IP (<code>kubectl cluster-info</code>).</li><li>Open the <strong>harness-delegate.yaml</strong> you used to create the Delegate, and add the cluster master hostname or IP to the <code>NO_PROXY</code> setting in the <code>StatefulSet</code> spec:</li></ol><pre>        - name: NO_PROXY<br/>          value: &#34;192.0.2.0&#34;</pre><ol><li style="counter-increment:li 2" start="3">Apply harness-delegate.yaml again to restart the Kubernetes Delegate (<code>kubectl apply -f harness-delegate.yaml</code>).</li></ol><h3>Artifact Collection</h3><p>This section lists common errors you might receive when Harness attempts to collect artifacts.</p><h4>Workflow Hanging on Artifact Collection</h4><p>If a Delegate has been offline for an extended period of time, you might need to reset the Harness Cloud Provider credentials by manually pulling the artifact in the Harness Service.</p><p>See <a href="/article/eb3kfl8uls-service-configuration#manually_select_an_artifact">Manually Select an Artifact</a>.</p><h3>Common Errors and Alerts</h3><p>This section lists common error and alert messages you might receive.</p><h4 id="no_delegates_could_reach_the_resource">No Delegates Could Reach The Resource</h4><p>This error means that no Delegate could meet the URL criteria for validation. When a task is ready to be assigned, the Harness Manager first validates its lists of Delegates to see which Delegate should be assigned the task. It validates the Delegate using the URL in the task, such as a API call or SSH command. See  <a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/migeq3achl-harness-delegate-faqs#how_does_harness_manager_identify_delegates">How Does Harness Manager Identify Delegates</a>ates?.</p><h4>Harness SecretStore Is Not Able to Encrypt/Decrypt</h4><p>Error message:</p><pre>Secret manager Harness SecretStore of type KMS is not able to encrypt/decrypt. Please check your setup</pre><p>This error results when Harness Secret Manager (named <strong>Harness SecretStore</strong>) is not able to encrypt or decrypt keys stored in AWS KMS. The error is usually transitory and is caused by a network connectivity issue or brief service outage.</p><p>Check <a href="https://status.harness.io/" target="_blank">Harness Site Status</a> and <a href="https://status.aws.amazon.com/">AWS Status</a> (search for <strong>AWS Key Management Service</strong>).</p><h4>Editing a Notification Group Based Rule Is Not Supported Anymore</h4><p>When trying to edit the <strong>Notification Strategy</strong> section of a Workflow, you might see this error message:</p><pre>Editing a Notification Group based rule is not supported anymore, please delete and create a new one</pre><p>Your Workflow might have some unsupported Notification Strategy setting that was not migrated to the current method for notifications.</p><p>To fix this, remove the existing Notification Strategy in one of the following ways:</p><ul><li>Click the <strong>X</strong> next to the strategy in the Workflow&#39;s <strong>Notification Strategy</strong> section, and then create a new strategy.<figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/articles/zu6097yamq/1560538578040/image.png" style="max-height:50%;max-width:50%" data-hd-height="50%" data-hd-width="50%"/></figure></li><li>Click the <strong>Configure As Code</strong> button (<strong>&lt;/&gt;</strong>) in the Workflow, delete instances of <code>notificationGroups</code>, and then create a new strategy.

Reason: Artifacts Are Missing for Service Name(S)</pre><p>This error can happen if a bad name for an artifact build version is placed in the cURL command. For example, a prefix in the artifact naming convention that was not added to the Trigger cURL command. Here is a cURL example showing a buildNumber <strong>v1.0.4-RC8</strong>:</p><pre>curl -X POST -H &#39;content-type: application/json&#39; <br/>--url https://app.harness.io/gateway/api/webhooks/TBsIRx. . . <br/>-d &#39;{&#34;application&#34;:&#34;tavXGH . . z7POg&#34;,&#34;artifacts&#34;:[<br/>{&#34;service&#34;:&#34;app&#34;,&#34;buildNumber&#34;:&#34;<strong>v1.0.4-RC8</strong>&#34;}]}’</pre><p>If the artifacts available for the Harness Service have a prefix or a different naming convention, such as <strong>myApp/v1.0.4-RC8</strong>, then the cURL command will not work.</p><p>Always ensure that the Webhook cURL command has the correct artifact name.</p><h4>Exception in WinRM Session</h4><p>When you deploy to a Windows environment, Harness makes a WinRM connection. Before it can make the connection, the Harness Delegate must be able to resolve any domain names for the target virtual network. If the target virtual network for a deployment does not have DNS enabled, you might see the following error:</p><pre>Exception in WinrmSession. . . Buffer already closed for writing</pre><p>Ensure that the virtual network allows DNS name resolution so that Harness can resolve names before running the WinRM connection. For more information, see <a href="/article/1n0t9vo7e4-1-delegate-and-connectors-for-iis">Delegate and Connectors for IIS</a> and <a href="/article/itseg37bji-iis-environments">IIS Environments in AWS and Azure</a>.</p><h4>You are not authorized to perform this operation: AmazonEC2: Status code 403</h4><p>This error occurs when you are testing a Harness AWS Cloud Provider and the credentials used for the connection do not include a policy with the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeRegions.html" target="_blank">DescribeRegions</a> action.</p><p>The DescribeRegions action is required for all AWS Cloud Providers regardless of what AWS service you are using as your deployment target (AMI/ASG, ECS, Lambda, etc).</p><p>Harness tests the connection using an API call for the DescribeRegions action.</p><p>This is described in <a href="/article/wt1gnigme7-add-amazon-web-services-cloud-provider">Add Amazon Web Services Cloud Provider</a>.</p><p>Ensure that one of the IAM roles assigned to the user account used for AWS Cloud Provider credentials (either associated with the Harness Delegate&#39;s host instance or the access key) contains the DescribeRegions action.</p><h4>Git-upload-pack not permitted</h4><p>One possible cause of this error is if you are using a Personal Access Token (PAT) for your GitHub Connector and your GitHub organization uses SAML single sign-on (SSO).</p><p>To use a personal access token with a GitHub organization that uses SAML single sign-on (SSO), you must first authorize the token. See <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/authentication/authenticating-with-saml-single-sign-on/authorizing-a-personal-access-token-for-use-with-saml-single-sign-on" target="_blank">Authorizing a personal access token for use with SAML single sign-on</a> from GitHub.</p><pre class="hljs perl">org.eclipse.jgit.api.errors.TransportException: https://github.com/*******/*******: git-upload-pack not permitted on </pre><h3>Naming Conventions</h3><p>Some naming conventions in repositories and other artifact sources, or in target infrastructures, cannot be used by Harness. For example, if a Harness Trigger Webhook uses a Push notification from a Git repo branch that contains a dot in its name, the Trigger is unlikely to work.</p><p>Character support in Harness Environment and Infrastructure Definition entity names is restricted to alphanumeric characters, underlines, and hyphens. The restriction is due to compatibility issues with Harness backend components, database keys, and the YAML flow where Harness creates files with entity names on file systems.</p><h3>Secrets</h3><p>The following issues can occur when using Harness secrets.</p><h4>Secrets Values Hidden In Log Output</h4><p>If a secret&#39;s unencrypted value shares some content with the value of another Harness variable, Harness will hide the secret&#39;s value in any logs. Harness replaces the secret&#39;s conflicting value with the secret&#39;s name in any log displays. This is for security only, and the actual value of the secrets and variables are still substituted correctly.</p><h4>AWS KMS 403</h4><p>The Harness Delegate runs in your target deployment environment and needs access to the default Harness AWS KMS for secrets management. If it does not have access, the following error can occur:</p><pre>Service: AWSKMS; Status Code: 403</pre><p>Ensure that the Delegate can reach the Harness KMS URL by logging into the Delegate host(s) and entering the following cURL command:</p><pre>curl https://kms.us-east-1.amazonaws.com</pre><p>Next, ensure that your proxies are not blocking the URL or port 443.</p><p>If this does not fix your error, and you are not using the default Harness KMS secret store, the AWS KMS access key provided in Harness for your own KMS store is likely invalid.</p><h3>Configure as Code and Git Sync</h3><p>The following issues can occur when using Harness Configure as Code and Git Sync.</p><h4>Git Push to Harness Fails</h4><p>If your Harness Application is synched two-way with your Git repo, the Git push to Harness might not work unless all of the required Application settings are fully-configured in your Git YAML files before pushing your Application up to Harness.</p><p>For example, if you have defined an Infrastructure Definition in your Git YAML files, but its required fields are incomplete, the push to Harness will likely fail.</p><p>This is no different than trying to submit incomplete settings in the Harness Manager.</p><p>In many cases, it is best to first use Harness Manager to configure your Application, ensuring all required settings are configured, and then sync that with your repo. Unless you remove any required settings in the Git files, the Application will sync with Harness successfully.</p><h4>Need to Reset History on Synced Git Repository</h4><p>In some cases where you sync your Git repo with Harness, you might need to reset the Git repo history because of an error, such as accidentally adding a secret&#39;s value in the repo. For example, Git has a <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History" target="_blank">Rewriting History</a> option.</p><p>To repair this scenario, do the following:</p><ol><li>Remove the Harness Webhook configured on your Git repo account (Github, Bitbucket, etc). This step is critical to ensure the Application history deletion does not propagate to Harness the next time it is synched.</li><li>Delete all of your Harness Applications on the Git account.</li><li>Re-sync each Harness Application using the Configuration As Code sync functionality. See <a href="/article/htvzryeqjw-configuration-as-code">Configuration as Code</a>.</li><li>Confirm that all of your Applications are visible in your Git repo.</li><li> <a href="mailto:support@harness.io" target="_blank">Notify Harness</a> to confirm we don&#39;t see any issues/errors in your account.</li><li>Enable the Webhook in Git repo and test syncing.</li></ol><h3>Triggers</h3><p>This section covers error messages you might see when creating, updating, deleting, or executing a Trigger. It includes authorization/permissions steps to resolve the errors.</p><h4>zsh: no matches found</h4><p>If you are using MacOS Catalina the default shell is zsh. The zsh shell requires that you escape the ? character in your cURL command or put quotes around the URL.</p><p>For example, this will fail:</p><pre>curl -X POST -H &#39;content-type: application/json&#39; --url https://app.harness.io/gateway/api/webhooks/xxx?accountId=xxx -d &#39;{&#34;application&#34;:&#34;fCLnFhwsTryU-HEdKDVZ1g&#34;,&#34;parameters&#34;:{&#34;Environment&#34;:&#34;K8sv2&#34;,&#34;test&#34;:&#34;foo&#34;}}&#39;</pre><p>This will work:</p><pre>curl -X POST -H &#39;content-type: application/json&#39; --url &#34;https://app.harness.io/gateway/api/webhooks/xxx?accountId=xxx -d &#39;{&#34;application&#34;:&#34;fCLnFhwsTryU-HEdKDVZ1g&#34;,&#34;parameters&#34;:{&#34;Environment&#34;:&#34;K8sv2&#34;,&#34;test&#34;:&#34;foo&#34;}}&#39;&#34;</pre><h4>About Triggers and Authorizations</h4><p>A Trigger involves multiple settings, including Service, Environment, and Workflow specifications. Harness examines these components as you set up a Trigger. You might be authorized for one component selected in a Trigger, such as a Service, but not another, such as an Environment. In these cases, an error message will alert you to missing authorizations.</p><p>To determine if you are authorized to create Triggers for a particular Environment or other components, review:</p><ul><li>All the permissions of your Harness User Group.</li><li>The Usage Scope of the Cloud Provider, and of any other Harness connectors you have set up.</li></ul><p>For further details, see <a href="/article/ven0bvulsj-users-and-permissions">Managing Users and Groups (RBAC)</a> and <a href="/article/a7n7lwsjpk-harness-connectors">Connectors Overview</a>.</p><h4>User does not have &#34;Deployment: execute&#34; permission</h4><p>Error messages of the form <code>User does not have &#34;Deployment: execute&#34; permission</code> indicate that your user group&#39;s <strong>Application Permissions</strong> &gt; <strong>Action</strong> settings do not include <strong>execute</strong> in the scope of the specified Application and/or Environment. To resolve this, see <a href="/article/ven0bvulsj-users-and-permissions#application_permissions">Application Permissions</a>.</p><h4>User not authorized</h4><p>The following error message indicates that a non-Administrator has tried to submit a Trigger whose <strong>Workflow Variables: Environment</strong> field is configured with a variable, rather than with a static Environment name:</p><p><code>User not authorized: Only members of the Account Administrator user group can create or update  Triggers with parameterized variables</code></p><p>Submitting a Pipeline Trigger that includes such a Workflow will generate the same error.</p><p>One resolution is to set the <strong>Environment</strong> field to a static value.

Information from stdout receives the prefix <code>INFO</code> while information from stderr receives the prefix <code>ERROR</code>. This is meant to allow our users to know where the information they see comes from.</p><p>Unfortunately, several Linux commands and applications use standard out as a way to print information to the screen that will not be captured if the output is captured to a file.</p><p>For example, the cURL command shows a download progress indication on the screen. If you redirect cURL output to a file the progress indicator is not captured in the file. This is done by showing the progress indicator in standard out. This is a very useful feature for many users, but for Harness is causes the progress indicator to be seen with the <code>ERROR</code> prefix.</p><p>You can test this for yourself with the following short example:</p><pre>curl https://app.harness.io/version.txt &gt;out.txt 2&gt;err.txt<br/><br/>cat out.txt<br/><br/>cat err.txt</pre><p>As you can see, the err.txt file has the cURL command output that in Harness will show with the <code>ERROR</code> prefix.</p><p>If Harness does not show standard error, then many errors will not be captured, confusing customers. Therefore, Harness shows the standard error in its logs.</p><h3>Verifications</h3><p>The following issues can occur with verifications.</p><h4>License Type Does Not Support Running This Verification</h4><p>Harness Continuous Verification is not <em>fully</em> supported for Harness Essentials and Community Editions. If you are running one of those editions, you might receive the following error:</p><p><code>Your license type does not support running this verification</code></p><p>For Harness Essentials and Community, Continuous Verification on metrics is supported for Prometheus, CloudWatch, and Stackdriver only.</p><p>You can upgrade to Harness Professional or use Prometheus, CloudWatch, and Stackdriver.</p><h4>Search Keyword Too Vague</h4><p>If a 24/7 Service Guard or deployment verification is not reporting any data, the search keywords for verification provider might be too broad.</p><p>For example, when you set up the 24/7 Service Guard or deployment verification step, you might have <code>level:ERROR</code> in the <strong>Search Keywords</strong> setting.</p><p>If the <strong>Search Keywords</strong> settings in the verification provider settings are too broad, when you click the <strong>Guide for Example</strong> button for the <strong>Host Name Field</strong>, <strong>Guide for Example</strong> can return field names for application records other than your target application.</p><p>To fix this, click <strong>Guide from Example</strong> several times. This will give you different field lists for the different applications until you find the correct field for the host name. Refreshing the browser can also pick up a new sample.</p><h3>AWS AMI</h3><p>The following errors might occur when setting up and deploying AMIs in Harness.

Should be in format Kind/Name</h4><p>The deployed Kubernetes object must reach steady state for Harness to be able to resolve the <code>${k8s.canaryWorkload}</code> expression.</p><p>Consequently, if the Canary Deployment step fails to deploy the workload to steady state, Harness cannot set the <code>${k8s.canaryWorkload}</code> expression and it will not execute successfully.</p><h4>IndexableReport: unbound variable</h4><p>If you are using the <code>${k8sResources.manifests}</code> expression to output the Kubernetes manifest in a Shell Script step, you might see an error like the following if the script is expecting a single line:</p><pre>ERROR 2021-11-17 11:48:52 harness-ASDljasdljALSjd.sh: line 484: IndexableReport: unbound variable</pre><p></p><p>Since the <code>${k8sResources.manifests}</code> expression results in a multiline output, any script expecting a single line will fail.</p><p>Instead, use <code>cat</code> like this:</p><pre>cat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt;&gt; /manifestOutput.yaml<br/>${k8sResources.manifests}<br/>EOF<br/><br/>cat /manifestOutput.yaml</pre><h4>The Deployment is invalid...may not be specified when `value` is not empty</h4><p>Every Harness deployment creates a new release with an incrementally increasing number. Release history is stored in the Kubernetes cluster in a ConfigMap. This ConfigMap is essential for release tracking, versioning and rollback.</p><p>If the ConfigMap is edited using kubectl or another tool between deployments future deployments often fail.</p><p>This type of error is experienced in standard Kubernetes deployments when attempting to use <code>kubectl apply</code> on a manifest whose resources have been previously modified using <code>kubectl edit</code>. For example, see the comments in this <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/78607" target="_blank">Kubernetes issue</a>.</p><h4>NullPointerException: Release Name is Reserved for Internal Harness ConfigMap</h4><p>The release name you enter in the Infrastructure Definition <strong>Release Name</strong> is reserved for the internal Harness ConfigMap used for tracking the deployment.</p><p>Do not create a ConfigMap that uses the same name as the release name. Your ConfigMap will override the Harness internal ConfigMap and cause a NullPointerException.</p><p>See <a href="/article/u3rp89v80h-define-your-kubernetes-target-infrastructure">Define Your Kubernetes Target Infrastructure</a>.</p><h4>The server doesn&#39;t have a resource type &#34;deployments&#34;</h4><p>When you attempt to connect to the Kubernetes cluster via <strong>GCP</strong>, the Kubernetes cluster must have <strong>Basic authentication enabled</strong> or the connection will fail.

From GCP:</p><p>You can handle cluster authentication in Google Kubernetes Engine by using Cloud IAM as the identity provider. However, legacy username-and-password-based authentication is enabled by default in Google Kubernetes Engine.

If you do not intervene, the deployment will fail.</p><h3>Shell Scripts</h3><p>This section covers common problems experienced when using the Shell Script command.</p><h4>FileNotFoundExeption inside shell script execution task</h4><p>This error happens when you are publishing output and your Shell Script step exits early from its script.</p><p>If you exit from the script (<code>exit 0</code>), values for the context cannot be read.</p><p>If you publish output variables in your Shell Script command, structure your script with <code>if...else</code> blocks to ensure it always runs to the end of the script.</p><h3>Submit a Ticket</h3><ol><li>Click the Help button in the Harness Manager.</li><li>Click <strong>Submit a Ticket</strong> or <strong>Send Screenshot</strong>.<figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/articles/j64rsg2v61/1532625733025/submit-ticket.png"/></figure></li><li>Fill out the ticket or screenshot forms and click <strong>Submit ticket</strong> or <strong>Send Feedback</strong>.</li></ol><p>Harness Support will contact you as soon as possible.</p>
