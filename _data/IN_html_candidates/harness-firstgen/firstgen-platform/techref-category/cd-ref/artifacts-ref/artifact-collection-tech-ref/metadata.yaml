  body: <p>This topic lists useful reference information for Harness artifact collection.</p><h3>Artifact
    History is Synced Every Two Hours</h3><p>Harness will sync with your artifact
    repositories every two hours to ensure Harness artifact cache is in sync with
    the repos.</p><p>If you deploy an artifact in Harness and see an artifact that
    you know is deleted in your repo, the artifact has been deleted within the two
    hours time frame.</p><p>The two hour time frame is the result of limitations of
    third-party APIs and repos.</p><p>You can manually or programmatically sync (and
    delete old artifacts from the Harness cache) using the Harness API.</p><p>See
    <a href="/article/7tlyu5jesf-sync-and-clean-up-artifact-stream-using-the-harness-api">Sync
    and Clean Up Artifact Stream using the Harness API</a>.</p><h3>See Also</h3><ul><li><a
