  short_version: Contains a list of currently-deprecated API features with their replacements.
  body: <p>This topic contains a list of currently-deprecated API features with their
    replacements. Some of the API features become obsolete and need to be removed
    or replaced because of the changing dependencies or to stay current with new best
    practices. To ensure a smooth transition, the API features are first deprecated
    for a period of time before getting removed.</p><h3>Before You Begin</h3><ul><li><a

    href="/article/ba4vs50071-use-workflows-api">Use Workflows API</a></li></ul><h3>Execution</h3><p>The
    <code>Execution</code> parameter in the API is deprecated. Use <code>PipelineExecution</code>
    or <code>WorkflowExecution</code> instead.</p><p>To maintain backward compatibility,
    if a request for <code>Execution</code> permission is received via the API, it
    is translated into <code>PipelineExecution</code> and <code>WorkflowExecution</code>.</p><p></p><p></p>
