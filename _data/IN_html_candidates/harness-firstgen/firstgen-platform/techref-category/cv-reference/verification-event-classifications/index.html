A <strong>Not a Risk</strong> event from the current execution becomes a <strong>Known Event</strong> in subsequent executions.</p><p>In many cases, an event is labeled <strong>Not a Risk</strong> because a Jira ticket for the event has been created and it is being resolved.</p><p>For anticipated events that do not need a P# assignment, assign the <strong>Not a Risk</strong> priority to the event. The events are added to the baseline of the analysis.</p><p>You can also change a <strong>Not a Risk</strong> event to a P# to pull it out of the baseline for subsequent executions.</p><h2>Anomalous Events</h2><p>Anomalous Events fail a deployment. Anomalous Events are events Harness has never seen before and are likely not good. You should assign a priority to the event.</p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/articles/339hy0kbnu/1620840128277/we-ee-5-t-uhrrdcmv-5-a-4-k-utgncf-64-blbe-tv-12-o-s-7-q-7-i-5-gwvf-ia-qyjtjo-7-tsfcpl-37-v-55-nu-s-0-t-7-mrg-1-e-73-se-cxm-0-ca-wnbojd-2-b-4-he-6-j-6-vd-nqjwcrsagfy-x-99-bymn-ehe-rwik-aye-hn-98"/></figure><h2>Priority Events</h2><p>Priority Events fail a deployment. They range in priority from P0 to P5. </p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/articles/339hy0kbnu/1620840128694/xj-ju-esj-47-md-8-tp-5-xnpa-1-jn-1-c-36-cn-wai-85-a-v-9-p-crlnwp-frxmdb-3-vgb-zhj-st-5-hpxdw-fyg-k-9-mu-k-zslg-6-tmz-0-vvsnp-9-trkoi-t-0-bjatmf-glbwv-bq-doc-zwu-x-1-k-cu-ap-lo-7-ld-61-h-ve-fcy"/></figure><p></p><p>Each priority number has a separate color associated with it:</p><p></p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/articles/339hy0kbnu/1574211119011/image.png" style="max-height:50%;max-width:50%" data-hd-height="50%" data-hd-width="50%"/></figure><p>You can change priority levels to specify the priority of the event. When you mark an even with a priority, Harness will identify the event with that priority in future analysis and fail the deployment if the event occurs.</p><div class="note-callout">You can assign a Jira issue for any event that has a priority assigned to it. For more information, see <a href="/article/v4d4pd5lxi-jira-cv-ticket">File Jira Tickets on Verification Events</a>.</div><p>If other matching events are discovered in future deployments, they will be assigned the same P#. The matching is performed by text matching with the event log data.</p><h4>Priority Events in 24/7 Service Guard</h4><p>While adding priority to events after a deployment is very useful (as described in <a href="https://harness.helpdocs.io/article/gd9skrjb4g-refine-deployment-verification-analysis">Refine Deployment Verification Analysis</a>), priority events are especially useful in 24/7 Service Guard.</p><p>24/7 Service Guard monitors your live, production application or service. You can mark events that show up in the live monitoring as P0-P5 and assign Jira issues for them, thereby fixing issues as soon as they show up. This prevents issues from surfacing during your next deployment.</p><p>See:</p><ul><li><a href="https://harness.helpdocs.io/article/4r2a5nc6q0-refine-24-7-service-guard-verification-analysis">Refine 24/7 Service Guard Verification Analysis</a></li><li><a href="/article/v4d4pd5lxi-jira-cv-ticket">File Jira Tickets on Verification Events</a></li></ul><h2>Auditing Event Prioritization</h2><p>Event prioritization is not currently recorded in the Harness <a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/kihlcbcnll-audit-trail">Audit Trail</a>, but when a Harness User changes the priority for an event, their name and the timestamp are recorded, and can be viewed by hovering over the priority.</p><p></p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/articles/339hy0kbnu/1620840128988/laro-5-l-5-r-jo-dsys-o-0-h-ag-fs-5-fkfndnnur-98-p-m-6-ca-8-u-8-yvz-4-qxz-6-hw-bhym-k-zkm-lk-f-8-qfe-kf-hfchrg-at-hbr-gi-huef-gkv-o-vq-qdpukzs-lopzs-qt-p-0-m-ew-su-siov-8-lfb-hkt-qz-nuz"/></figure><p></p>
