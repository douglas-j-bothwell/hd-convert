<p>The following limitations and restrictions apply to Harness variable expressions.</p><p>For general details about Harness variable expressions, see:</p><ul><li><a href="/article/9dvxcegm90-variables">What is a Harness Variable Expression?</a></li><li><a href="/article/aza65y4af6-built-in-variables-list">Built-in Variables List</a></li></ul><h3>Limitations</h3><ul><li>Harness does not support the Ternary conditional <code>?:</code> operator from <a href="http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-jexl/reference/syntax.html#Operators" target="_blank">JEXL</a>.</li><li>Harness permits variables only within their scope. You will not see a variable available in a field where it cannot be used. For example, if you use a Service Config variable you cannot resolves its expression in the <strong>Pre-deployment</strong> section of a Workflow because the Service is not used in <strong>Pre-deployment</strong>.</li><li>Do not use hyphens (dashes) in variable names, as some Linux distributions and deployment-related software do not allow them.</li><li>A variable value (the evaluated expression) is limited to 256 KB.</li></ul><h3>Variable Expression Name Restrictions</h3><p>A variable name is the name in the variable expression, <code>${variable_name}</code>.</p><p>Variable names may only contain <code>a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _</code>. They cannot contain hyphens or dots.</p><div class="note-callout">Certain platforms and orchestration tools, like Kubernetes, have their own naming restrictions. For example, Kubernetes doesn&#39;t allow underscores. Make sure that whatever expressions you use resolve to the allowed values of your target platforms.</div><p>The following keywords are reserved, and cannot be used as a variable name or property:</p><p><code>or and eq ne lt gt le ge div mod not null true false new var return shellScriptProvisioner</code></p><p>See <a href="https://people.apache.org/~henrib/jexl-3.0/reference/syntax.html" target="_blank">JEXL grammar details</a>.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>
