  body: <p>The following limitations and restrictions apply to Harness variable expressions.</p><p>For
    general details about Harness variable expressions, see:</p><ul><li><a href="/article/9dvxcegm90-variables">What
    is a Harness Variable Expression?</a></li><li><a href="/article/aza65y4af6-built-in-variables-list">Built-in
    Variables List</a></li></ul><h3>Limitations</h3><ul><li>Harness does not support
    the Ternary conditional <code>?:</code> operator from <a href="http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-jexl/reference/syntax.html#Operators"
    target="_blank">JEXL</a>.</li><li>Harness permits variables only within their
    scope. You will not see a variable available in a field where it cannot be used.
    For example, if you use a Service Config variable you cannot resolves its expression
    in the <strong>Pre-deployment</strong> section of a Workflow because the Service
    is not used in <strong>Pre-deployment</strong>.</li><li>Do not use hyphens (dashes)
    in variable names, as some Linux distributions and deployment-related software
    do not allow them.</li><li>A variable value (the evaluated expression) is limited
    to 256 KB.</li></ul><h3>Variable Expression Name Restrictions</h3><p>A variable
    name is the name in the variable expression, <code>${variable_name}</code>.</p><p>Variable
    names may only contain <code>a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _</code>. They cannot contain hyphens
    or dots.</p><div class="note-callout">Certain platforms and orchestration tools,
    like Kubernetes, have their own naming restrictions. For example, Kubernetes doesn&#39;t
    allow underscores. Make sure that whatever expressions you use resolve to the
    allowed values of your target platforms.</div><p>The following keywords are reserved,
    and cannot be used as a variable name or property:</p><p><code>or and eq ne lt
    gt le ge div mod not null true false new var return shellScriptProvisioner</code></p><p>See
    <a href="https://people.apache.org/~henrib/jexl-3.0/reference/syntax.html" target="_blank">JEXL
    grammar details</a>.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>
