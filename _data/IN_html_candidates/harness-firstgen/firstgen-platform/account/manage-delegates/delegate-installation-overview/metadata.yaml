    Summary</h3><p>The following diagram shows how the Delegate enables Harness to
    integrate with all of your deployment resources:</p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/articles/8o4cwqj1kv/1596840107816/image.png"/></figure><h3>Delegate
    Types</h3><p>Harness provides different types of Delegates to give you flexibility
    in how your manage deployments.</p><p>In many cases, you will use a Kubernetes
    Delegate for Kubernetes deployments, and an ECS Delegate for ECS deployments,
    and so on.</p><p>But you are not limited to using a Delegate of the same type
    as your deployment platform. You can use a Shell Script Delegate running in a
    VM with a Kubernetes deployment, although that is more complicated to set up initially.</p><div
    class="note-callout">For information on targeting Delegates to different Kubernetes
    namespaces, see <a href="/article/p91u0bxtaf-enable-delegate-to-deploy-to-multiple-kubernetes-namespaces">Target
    Delegates to Specific Namespaces</a>.</div><p>You can install the following types
    of Delegates:</p><ul><li> <a href="/article/0hn6vdpeqz-install-kubernetes-delegate">Kubernetes

    Delegate</a></li><li> <a href="/article/hnvvwbhbdu-install-docker-delegate">Docker
    Delegate</a></li></ul><h3>Where do I Install the Delegate?</h3><ul><li><strong>Evaluating
    Harness</strong> - When evaluating Harness, you might want to install the Delegate
    locally. Ensure that it has access to the artifact sources, deployment environments,
    and verification providers you want to use with Harness.</li><li><strong>Development,
    QA, and Production</strong> - The Delegate should be installed behind your firewall
    and in the same VPC as the micro-services you are deploying. The Delegate must
    have access to the artifact servers, deployment environments, and cloud providers
    it needs.</li></ul><h3>Delegate Updates</h3><p>The Delegate updates automatically.
    The Delegate installation also installs a <strong>Watcher</strong> program that
    checks the Harness cloud periodically for new versions.</p><p>Watcher checks regularly
    with the Harness cloud to see what published Delegate versions should be running.
    Watcher ensures there is exactly one Delegate process of each published version
    running.</p><p>If there is a published version that is not running, Watcher downloads
    the jar file for that version securely over HTTPS, installs it, and updates the
    Delegate connection to the Harness Manager. There is no downtime.</p><h4>What
    Happens to the Old Delegate?</h4><p>Harness keeps the last Delegate&#39;s files
    (JARS, logs, etc) in case you need to rollback. Any previous Delegate&#39;s files
    are removed by Harness.</p><h3>How Does Harness Manager Identify Delegates?</h3><p>All
    Delegates are identified by your Harness account ID. But, depending on the type
    of Delegate, there are additional factors.</p><p>For Delegates running on virtual
    machines, such as the Shell Script and Docker Delegates running on an AWS EC2
    instance, the Delegate is identified by the combination of <strong>Hostname</strong>
    and <strong>IP</strong>:</p><p></p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/articles/h9tkwmkrm7/1560383229070/image.png"
    style="max-height:50%;max-width:50%" data-hd-height="50%" data-hd-width="50%"/></figure><p>Therefore,
    if the hostname or IP changes on the VM, the Delegate cannot be identified by
    the Harness Manager. The IP used is the private IP. The Delegate connects to the
    Harness Manager, but the Harness Manager does not initiate a connection to the
    Delegate, and so the public IP address of the Delegate is not needed, typically.</p><p>For
    Kubernetes and ECS Delegates, the IP can change if a pod is rescheduled, for example.
    Consequently, Kubernetes Delegates are identified by a suffix using a unique six
    letter code in their <strong>Hostname</strong> (the first six letters that occur
    in your account ID):</p><p></p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/articles/h9tkwmkrm7/1560383507971/image.png"
    style="max-height:50%;max-width:50%" data-hd-height="50%" data-hd-width="50%"/></figure><p>ECS
    Delegates are identified by the <strong>Hostname</strong> entered when the ECS
    Delegate Task Spec is downloaded:</p><p></p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/articles/h9tkwmkrm7/1560465943276/image.png"
    style="max-height:50%;max-width:50%" data-hd-height="50%" data-hd-width="50%"/></figure><h3>Harness
    Delegate Link TTL</h3><p>When you add a Delegate, you can copy a link to it that
    you can paste and run in the terminal.</p><p>The link has a TTL of 1 hour. After
    that, you need to copy a new link.</p><h3>Troubleshooting</h3><p>See the Delegate-related
    content in Harness <a href="/article/g9o2g5jbye-troubleshooting-harness">Troubleshooting</a>.</p><p></p>
