  body: '<p>To integrate Harness with some third-party apps, you need to register
    Harness with the app and then supply a Harness API key. The API key is a simple
    encrypted string that other applications can use to access Harness without a private
    Harness account.</p><div class="tip-callout">Once you have generated an API key
    in Harness, deployment status can be tracked by making a REST call to Harness.
    For more information, see <a href="/article/uccck6kq5m-get-deployment-status-using-rest">Get
    Deployment Status using REST</a>.</div><h3>Create an API Key</h3><p>The following
    procedure creates, copies, and deletes an API Key.</p><p>To use a Harness API
    key, do the following:</p><ol><li>In Harness Manager, click <strong>Security</strong>,
    and then click <strong>Access Management</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>API Keys</strong>.</li><li>Click
    <strong>Add API Key</strong>.</li><li>In the <strong>Add API Key</strong> settings,
    enter a name and select your User Group.</li><li>Click <strong>Submit</strong>.
    The new API key is created.</li><li>To copy the API key, first click the Eye icon
    to reveal the key&#39;s value.</li><li>Next, click the Copy icon beside the key.
    This copies the key&#39;s value to your clipboard.</li><li>To delete an API key,
    click the <strong>Delete</strong> icon.</li></ol><h3>Edit an API Key</h3><p>To
    edit a Harness API key, do the following:</p><ol><li>In Harness Manager, click
    <strong>Security</strong>, and then click <strong>Access Management</strong>.</li><li>Click
    <strong>API Keys</strong>.</li><li>Click the <strong>Edit</strong> icon beside
    the key. The <strong>Edit API Key</strong> settings appear.</li><li>Edit the API
    key and click <strong>Submit</strong>.</li></ol><h3>Use an API Key and REST</h3><p>You
    can use a RESt call to track the details of your Harness deployments. An API key
    is required in the call header in the REST call to Harness. The API key uniquely
    identifies your Harness account and authorizes access to your account data.</p><div

    status can be tracked by making a REST call to Harness. For more information,
    see <a href="/article/uccck6kq5m-get-deployment-status-using-rest">Get Deployment
    Status using REST</a>.</div><h3>Troubleshooting</h3><p>The Harness API has a usage
    rate limit of <strong>1 query per second per API Key</strong>. If the rate limit
    is reached, you will receive this response in the API call:</p><pre>Too Many requests.
    Throttled. Max QPS: 1.0</pre><p></p>'
