Before setting these permissions, it&#39;s important to understand how they interact with each other:</p><ul><li><strong>Account permissions</strong> affect the high-level permissions for the users in a group, such as the ability to add an application, manage users and groups, and manage their account.</li><li><strong>Application permissions</strong> affect the low-level permissions for the users in a group, such as the ability to place <strong>Usage Scope</strong> on a secret that applies to a specific service.</li></ul><p>For most users, you will want to apply <strong>Application permissions</strong>. <strong>Account</strong> <strong>permissions</strong> are primarily for administration.</p><h4>Permissions Are Additive</h4><p>When a Harness User is a member of two or more User Groups, that user&#39;s permissions are a union (a combination) of both User Groups&#39; permissions.</p><h4>Permissions Example</h4><p>A user group might have the <strong>Account permission</strong> to add an application, but only the <strong>Application permission</strong> to add services:</p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/articles/ven0bvulsj/1633431844716/screenshot-2021-10-05-at-4-32-43-pm.png" style="max-height:50%;max-width:50%" data-hd-height="50%" data-hd-width="50%"/></figure><p>Users in this group will be able to create applications and add Services to them, but not will not be able to add Environments, Workflows, or other Application components.</p><h3>Account Permissions</h3><p>Account-level permissions are enabled in each <strong>User Group</strong> page, under <strong>Account Permissions</strong>.</p><p>Account permissions enable the following Harness features:</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Account Permission</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Details</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Manage Applications</strong></p></td><td><p>This permission is for managing Harness Application defaults.</p><p>You can create, update, and delete Applications in your account.
