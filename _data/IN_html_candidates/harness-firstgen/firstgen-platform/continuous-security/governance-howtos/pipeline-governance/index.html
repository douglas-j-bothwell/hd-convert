After you create Workflows that perform or verify some regulatory operation, you describe them using <a href="/article/nrxfix3i58-tags">Tags</a>.</p><p>Next, you use those Tags to create rules in a Pipeline Governance Standard. You assign a weight to each rule to indicate how important it is.</p><p>The standards are used to score the conformance of Pipelines. A score lets you measure the conformance level of the Workflows a Pipeline contains.</p><p>You can see the score before you deploy a Pipeline, and during Pipeline Approval steps.</p><p>Below is an example of a Pipeline Governance Standard and how a Pipeline Approval step measures conformance with the standard during deployment:</p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/other/1571264351741/image.png"/></figure><p>Let&#39;s take a high-level view of the major steps:</p><ol><li>Create Workflows and Pipelines that meet or perform regulatory operations for your application.</li><li>Add <a href="/article/nrxfix3i58-tags">Tags</a> to your Workflows to identify what operations they perform, such as PCI, FDIC, etc. Here are two Workflows with Tags that identify their regulatory operations:<figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/other/1571264793258/image.png"/></figure></li><li>Add Pipeline Governance Standards to your Harness Application:<ol><li>Create Governance Standards rules in <strong>Pipeline Governance</strong> by selecting the Tags you added.</li><li>Weight each rule to set its importance. In this example, both rules are weighted as 1, meaning they are equally important:<figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/other/1571267452473/image.png"/></figure></li></ol></li><li>Measure conformance before and during deployment:<br/><br/>Before you deploy a Pipeline that has Governance Standards applied to it, Harness displays the conformance as a percentage. The following example shows a score of 100% because the Pipeline contains both conformance Workflows:<figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/other/1571353885888/image.png"/></figure>During Pipeline deployment, any Approval steps in the Pipeline measure how the Pipeline meets all Governance Standards. This measurement allows you to decide to approve or reject the Pipeline deployment.</li></ol><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/articles/zhqccv0pff/1620840141673/h-ulu-tx-7-fryt-hidtx-4-p-e-0-byy-jlh-putt-gjac-9-t-ruz-yiy-zbi-atz-jpxp-fur-ub-3-ueb-susj-1-r-sbf-xb-lhr-0-my-7-snh-d-1-jj-m-2-ypz-bpoy-rfhvd-0-t-j-1-a-hn-o-6-wjl-mqp-ez-orz-ifsr-z-4-p-ssk-jrg-8-ez-cq"/></figure><p>In this topic, we will cover adding Pipeline Governance Standards and measuring conformance before and during deployment.</p><p>Learn how to add Tags to your Applications, Workflows, and Pipelines in <a href="/article/nrxfix3i58-tags">Using Tags</a>.</p><h3>Prerequisites</h3><p>This topic covers creating and applying Pipeline Governance Standards, and assumes you are familiar with Harness Tags (see <a href="/article/nrxfix3i58-tags">Using Tags</a>).</p><p>This topic assumes that you have the following prerequisites:</p><ul><li>A Pipeline containing Workflows that meet or evaluate standards and regulations.</li><li>Tags on the Workflows that indicate their regulatory function, such as <strong>PCI Compliance</strong>.</li></ul><p>Here is an example of a Pipeline containing two Workflows, each tagged with a Tag that describes their regulatory conformance:</p><p></p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/other/1571265638090/image.png"/></figure><h3>Add a Pipeline Governance Standard</h3><p>A Pipeline Governance Standard is comprised of rules. A rule contains one or more of the Tags assigned to your conformance Workflows. Each rule is given a weight relative to its importance.</p><p>To add a Pipeline Governance Standard, do the following:</p><ol><li>Before you begin, review <a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/zhqccv0pff/preview#prerequisites">Prerequisites</a>.</li><li>In Harness, click <strong>Continuous Security</strong>, and then click <strong>Governance</strong>. The Governance page displays the existing Pipeline Governance standards.<figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/other/1571267818630/image.png" style="max-height:75%;max-width:75%" data-hd-height="75%" data-hd-width="75%"/></figure></li><li>Click <strong>Add Governance Standard</strong>. The Pipeline Governance Standard settings appear.<figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/other/1571268089287/image.png" style="max-height:50%;max-width:50%" data-hd-height="50%" data-hd-width="50%"/></figure></li><li>In <strong>Name</strong>, enter a name that will identify the standard when it appears in Pipelines and Pipeline Approval steps.</li><li>In <strong>Description</strong>, describe what the standard will evaluate, like <strong>FDIC Compliance</strong>.</li><li>In <strong>Conformance Rule</strong>, click <strong>Add Rule</strong>. Define the <strong>Conformance Rule</strong> for the standard as described below.</li></ol><h4>Define Conformance Rules</h4><p>Conformance Rules are a combination of the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Tags</strong> you have assigned to Workflows.</li><li><strong>Matching</strong> requirements for the Tags, such as ANY or ALL.</li><li><strong>Weights</strong> that you assign to each rule to define its importance relative to other rules.</li></ul><p>To define a conformance rule, do the following:</p><ol><li>In <strong>Conformance Rule</strong>, click <strong>Tag</strong>. The Tag search appears.</li><li>Select the Tag that you want to add to the rule, and then click <strong>Submit</strong>. For example, if you have a Workflow with the Tag <strong>PCI Compliance</strong>, you would select <strong>PCI Compliance</strong> in the Tag search.</li></ol><p></p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/other/1571269056857/image.png"/></figure><div class="note-callout">You can also create the Tag and add it to the Workflow later. Typically, Tags are added to the Workflow first.</div><ol><li style="counter-increment:li 2" start="3">Add as many Tags as you need to identify the Workflows that the rule applies to.</li><li>If you added multiple Tags, in <strong>Match</strong>, select <strong>ALL</strong> to apply the rule only when all the Tags are present in a Pipeline, or <strong>ANY</strong> to apply the rule when any of the Tags are present.</li><li>In <strong>Weight</strong>, enter a value to define the importance of the rule. You might what to create all of the rules first, and then assign their weights.<br/><br/>When your standard is displayed in a Pipeline or Pipeline Approval step, its weights are presented as a percentage using the formula <em>Weight / Sum of Weight = Percentage</em>.<br/><br/>For example, here the rules are weighted 4 and 6, and when they are displayed in a Pipeline, they are scored 40% and 60%:<figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/other/1571270120866/image.png"/></figure></li><li>For each rule, click the <strong>Note</strong> icon to add any notes that can provide information for other users.</li><li>Repeat the above steps to add more rules, if needed.</li><li>Click <strong>Submit</strong>. The new Pipeline Governance Standard is added to the <strong>Governance</strong> page under <strong>Pipeline Governance</strong>.</li></ol><p></p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/other/1571270374887/image.png"/></figure><p>By default, this standard is available to every Application in your Harness account. Every Pipeline you open or create will display this standard and indicate how the Pipeline measures up. In a new Pipeline with no steps, you can see that the standard has a 0% score for each rule and their <strong>Occurrence</strong> is empty:</p><p></p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/other/1571270551876/image.png"/></figure><p>In a Pipeline that includes a only one Workflow assigned a rule&#39;s Tag, the weight is <strong>4(40%)</strong> and the total score is <strong>40%</strong>:</p><p></p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/other/1571270965177/image.png"/></figure><p></p><h4>Scope Standards using Advanced Settings</h4><p>By default, when you create a Pipeline Governance Standard it is available to every Application in your account. Consequently, it appears on every Pipeline and as part of every Approval step.</p><p>If the default scope of a Pipeline Governance Standard is too wide, in the <strong>Advanced Settings</strong> of the Pipeline Governance Standard you can limit the Applications that can use the standard.</p><p></p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/other/1571354123000/image.png"/></figure><p>To limit the Applications that can use the standard, do the following:</p><ol><li>Click <strong>Advanced Settings</strong> to expand it.</li><li>In <strong>Applications</strong>, select the Applications that may use the standard.</li><li>In <strong>Tags</strong>, select the Tags of Applications and Pipelines that may use the standard.</li><li>Click <strong>Submit</strong>.</li></ol><p>The standard is now limited to the Applications you selected and/or components tagged with the Tags you selected.</p><h4>Drafting Pipeline Governance Standards Without Applying Them</h4><p>If you want to draft a Pipeline Governance Standard, but not have it appear in every Application, Pipeline, and Approval step in your account, you can scope the standard to a Tag that is not applied to any Application or Pipeline.</p><p>For example, you can create a Tag in <a href="/article/nrxfix3i58-tags">Tags Management</a> named <strong>Draft Compliance</strong>, and not apply it to any Application or Pipeline. Then, in <strong>Advanced Settings</strong>&#39; in the Pipeline Governance Standard, select <strong>Draft Compliance</strong> in <strong>Tags</strong>:</p><p></p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/other/1571355452495/image.png" style="max-height:75%;max-width:75%" data-hd-height="75%" data-hd-width="75%"/></figure><p>Now the draft Pipeline Governance Standard is not applied to any Application or Pipeline.</p><h3>Measure Conformance Before Deployment</h3><p>When you open a Pipeline in Harness, you will see all of the Pipeline Governance Standards available to it, and their individual scores.</p><p></p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/other/1571353425254/image.png"/></figure><p>The scores indicate how many of the Tags that define the Pipeline Governance Standard are present in the Pipeline&#39;s Workflows, and their relative weight.</p><p>Scoring provides you with an overall view of the conformance of your Pipeline, helping you to make an educated decision on whether or not to deploy the Pipeline.</p><p>In some cases, a Pipeline Governance Standard might not be relevant but it is displayed in a Pipeline page because it has not been scoped to specific Applications and Pipelines. To scope a Pipeline Governance Standard, see <a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/zhqccv0pff-pipeline-governance#scope_standards_using_advanced_settings">Scope Standards using Advanced Settings</a>.</p><h3>Measure Conformance During Deployment</h3><p>Approval steps in Pipelines display the Pipeline Governance Standards available to that Pipeline.</p><p>For example, here is an Approval step in a Pipeline displaying two standards and their scores:</p><p></p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/articles/zhqccv0pff/1620840142090/9-hfst-j-2-qsroep-mdp-wrixakx-yh-aqisw-sigw-byg-z-2-e-8-syd-3-h-zlq-9-vf-zkt-sfvee-zua-a-4-g-lq-2-b-1-lp-ckzb-a-5-yfl-dx-mxf-nnzi-bcgpf-bq-otc-ah-q-2-y-9-cy-gw-2-gdt-m-narp-a-7-gyin-2-z-cfla-hu-i" style="max-height:75%;max-width:75%" data-hd-height="75%" data-hd-width="75%"/></figure><p>The <strong>Gold Standard</strong> has a score of <strong>0%</strong> because no Workflow in the Pipeline includes the Tags defined in the Gold Standard.</p><p>The <strong>Doc-Example</strong> has a score of 100% because the Workflows in the Pipeline, or Pipeline itself, include the Tags defined in <strong>Doc-Example</strong>.</p><p>Now you can evaluate the conformance of the Pipeline before approving its deployment.</p><h3>Related Topics</h3><ul><li><a href="/article/nrxfix3i58-tags">Using Tags</a></li><li><a href="/article/0ajz35u2hy-approvals">Approvals</a></li></ul><p></p>
