  body: '<div class="note-callout">Currently, this feature is behind the <code>NEW_DEPLOYMENT_FREEZE</code>
    feature flag. Contact <a href="mailto:support@harness.io" target="_blank">Harness
    Support</a> to enable the feature.</div><p></p><p>Deployment Freeze is a Harness
    Governance feature that stops all Harness deployments. A deployment freeze helps
    ensure stability during periods of low engineering and support activity, such
    as holidays, trade shows, or company events. For steps to freeze deployments through
    Harness API, see <a href="/article/vwu8tynfc4-use-deployment-freeze-api">Use Deployment
    Freeze API</a>.</p><h3>Before You Begin</h3><ul><li><a href="/category/cwefyz0jos-deployments-overview">Deployments

    href="/article/zc1u96u6uj-pipeline-configuration">Create a Pipeline</a></li><li>Make
    sure you have <strong>Administer Other Account Functions</strong> permissions
    to access Governance in Harness. For more information, see <a href="/article/ven0bvulsj-users-and-permissions#account_permissions">Account
    Permissions</a>.</li></ul><h3>Deployment Freeze Overview</h3><p>Typically, the
    more automated a deployment is, the safer it becomes. Automated deployments remove
    the errors that cause risk because they are a continual process.</p><p>Yet, there
    are times when even the few personnel needed for Harness deployments are occupied
    with other events, such as holidays. In these cases, freezing deployments helps
    prevent deployments from introducing new issues.</p><p>Freezing Harness deployments
    does not mean that changes aren&#39;t happening in the deployment environment.
    User and system events are always taking place, and your microservice dependencies
    remain active.</p><p>When a deployment freeze window is enabled:</p><ul><li>Deployments
    cannot be started manually or using a Trigger.</li><li>Active deployments are
    allowed to complete.</li><li>During execution if a Pipeline hits a stage with
    an Environment that has a deployment freeze enabled, then the Pipeline gets rejected.
    You can resume the rejected Pipelines from the previous state once the deployment
    freeze window is over. See <a href="/article/4dvyslwbun-resume-a-pipeline-deployment">Resume
    Pipeline Deployments</a>.</li><li>If the <u>first</u> stage of a Pipeline (or
    a Workflow) uses an Environment that has a deployment freeze enabled, then you
    need to wait for the deployment freeze window to be over before triggering the
    deployment. See <a href="/article/xerirloz9a-add-a-trigger-2">Trigger Workflows
    and Pipelines</a>.</li></ul><p></p><h3>Step: Add a Freeze Window</h3><p>Perform
