<p></p><p>Harness Tanzu Application Service (formerly PCF) Blue/Green deployments use the route(s) in the TAS manifest.yml and a temporary route you specify in the Harness Workflow.</p><p>The Workflow deploys the app using the temporary route first using the <strong>App Setup</strong> command. Next, in the <strong>App Resize</strong> command, Harness maintains the number of instances at 100% of the <code>instances</code> specified in the manifest.yml.</p><p>For Blue/Green deployments, the <strong>App Resize</strong> step is always 100% because it does not change the number of instances as it did in the Canary deployment. In Blue/Green, you are simply deploying the new app to the number of instances set in the <strong>App Setup</strong> step and keeping the old app at the same number of instances (100% count).</p><p>Once that deployment is successful, the Workflow <strong>Swap Routes</strong> command switches the networking routing, directing production traffic (Green) to the new app and stage traffic (Blue) to the old app.</p><p>In this topic:</p><ul><li><a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/52muxcsr1v-create-a-blue-green-pcf-deployment#before_you_begin">Before You Begin</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/52muxcsr1v-create-a-blue-green-pcf-deployment#visual_summary">Visual Summary</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/52muxcsr1v-create-a-blue-green-pcf-deployment#step_1_specify_the_tas_service_routes">Step 1: Specify the TAS Service Routes</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/52muxcsr1v-create-a-blue-green-pcf-deployment#step_2_set_up_a_tas_blue_green_workflow">Step 2: Set Up a TAS Blue/Green Workflow</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/52muxcsr1v-create-a-blue-green-pcf-deployment#step_3_app_setup">Step 3: App Setup</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/52muxcsr1v-create-a-blue-green-pcf-deployment#step_4_app_resize">Step 4: App Resize</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/52muxcsr1v-create-a-blue-green-pcf-deployment#step_5_verify_staging">Step 5: Verify Staging</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/52muxcsr1v-create-a-blue-green-pcf-deployment#step_6_swap_routes">Step 6: Swap Routes</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/52muxcsr1v-create-a-blue-green-pcf-deployment#step_7_deploy_a_tas_blue_green_workflow">Step 7: Deploy a TAS Blue/Green Workflow</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/52muxcsr1v-create-a-blue-green-pcf-deployment#app_versioning_without_numbering">App Versioning without Numbering</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/52muxcsr1v-create-a-blue-green-pcf-deployment#app_name_variables_and_blue_green_deployments">App Name Variables and Blue Green Deployments</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/52muxcsr1v-create-a-blue-green-pcf-deployment#next_steps">Next Steps</a></li></ul><p></p><h3>Before You Begin</h3><ul><li>See <a href="/article/nh4afrhvkl">Connect to Your Target Tanzu Account</a>.</li><li>See <a href="/article/r1crlrpjk4">Define Your Tanzu Target Infrastructure</a>.</li></ul><p></p><h3>Visual Summary</h3><p>Here&#39;s the output after a successful Blue/Green TAS Deployment.</p><p></p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/other/1572471572840/image.png"/></figure><p></p><h3>Step 1: Specify the TAS Service Routes</h3><p>In the manifest.yml in your Harness TAS Service, you can specify the route(s) to use for the Blue/Green deployment. For example:</p><pre>  ...<br/>  routes:<br/>  - route: example.com</pre><p>Each route for the app is created if it does not already exist.</p><p>As you will see when you set up the Blue/Green Workflow, you specify a temporary route in the App Setup command&#39;s <strong>Temporary Routes</strong> setting:</p><p></p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/articles/9ao4gsr93j/1580332058626/image.png" style="max-height:50%;max-width:50%" data-hd-height="50%" data-hd-width="50%"/></figure><h3>Step 2: Set Up a TAS Blue/Green Workflow</h3><p>To explain TAS Blue/Green Workflow commands and settings, we will create a Blue/Green Workflow that uses a temporary route and, if it is successful, deploys 100% of instances using the primary route.</p><p>To implement this Blue/Green Workflow, do the following:</p><ol><li>In your Harness Application, click <strong>Workflows</strong>.</li><li>In <strong>Workflows</strong>, click Add Workflow. The <strong>Workflow</strong> dialog appears.</li><li>In <strong>Name</strong>, enter a name for the Workflow.</li><li>In <strong>Workflow Type</strong>, select <strong>Blue/Green Deployment</strong>.</li><li>In <strong>Environment</strong>, select the Environment you created for TAS.</li><li>In <strong>Service</strong>, select a Harness TAS Service you have created. The Service manifest.yml must contain a <code>route</code>. The route can be an existing route or not. If the doesn&#39;t exist, Harness will create it for you. This is the route that will be used at the final stage of the Blue/Green deployment. The temporary route for the prior stage will be selected in the <strong>App Setup</strong> step of Workflow.</li><li>In <strong>Infrastructure Definition</strong>, select the Infrastructure Definition that describes the target TAS space.</li><li>Click <strong>Submit</strong>.</li></ol><p>The new Blue/Green Workflow is displayed, along with the preconfigured steps:</p><p></p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/other/1572473530244/image.png"/></figure><p></p><h3>Step 3: App Setup</h3><p>Click <strong>App Setup</strong> to see the default, preconfigured command:</p><p></p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/articles/9ao4gsr93j/1580332136704/image.png" style="max-height:50%;max-width:50%" data-hd-height="50%" data-hd-width="50%"/></figure><p>None of the settings in this dialog are mandatory, but for Blue/Green Workflows, the <strong>Match running instances</strong>, <strong>Additional Routes</strong>, and <strong>Temporary Routes</strong> settings are important.</p><p>If you select <strong>Match running instances</strong>, Harness will ignore the number of instances set in the Service&#39;s manifest.yml <code>instances</code> property and use the number of currently running instances as the desired instance count during deployment.</p><p>The first time you deploy this Workflow, there is no reason to select <strong>Match running instances</strong> as there are no current running instances.</p><p><strong>Additional Routes</strong> is automatically populated with the routes Harness can find using the Infrastructure Definition you selected for this Workflow</p><p><strong>Additional Routes</strong> has two uses in Blue/Green deployments:</p><ul><li>Select the routes that you want mapped to the app in addition to the routes already mapped in the app in the manifest in your Harness Service.</li><li>You can also omit routes in the manifest in your Harness Service, and simply select them in <strong>Additional Routes</strong>. The routes selected in <strong>Additional Routes</strong> will be used as the final (green) routes for the app.</li></ul><p><strong>Temporary Routes</strong> is automatically populated with the routes Harness can find using the Infrastructure Definition you selected for this Workflow.</p><p>In <strong>Temporary Routes</strong>, you can select one or more temporary routes for Harness to use when it creates the TAS app. Later, in the <strong>Swap State</strong> step, Harness will replace these routes with the routes in the manifest.yml <code>routes</code> property in your Service.</p><p>If you do not select a route in <strong>Temporary Routes</strong>, Harness will create one automatically.</p><p>For information on using the <strong>Use App Autoscaler Plugin</strong> settings, see <a href="/article/4xh8u7l86h-use-the-app-autoscaler-service">Use the App Autoscaler Service</a>.</p><p>In <strong>Timeout</strong>, set how long you want the Harness Delegate to wait for the TAS cloud to respond to API requests before timing out.</p><p>In <strong>Delegate Selectors</strong>, select the Selector for the Delegate(s) you want to use. You add Selectors to Delegates to make sure that they&#39;re used to execute the command. For more information, see <a href="/article/c3fvixpgsl-select-delegates-for-specific-tasks-with-selectors">Select Delegates with Selectors</a>.</p><p>Harness will use Delegates matching the Selectors you add.</p><p>If you use one Selector, Harness will use any Delegate that has that Selector.</p><p>If you select two Selectors, a Delegate must have both Selectors to be selected. That Delegate might also have other Selectors, but it must have the two you selected.</p><div class="note-callout">You can use expressions for Harness built-in variables or Account Default variables in <strong>Delegate Selectors</strong>. When the variable expression is resolved at deployment runtime, it must match an existing Delegate Selector.<br/><br/>For example, if you have a Delegate Selector <strong>prod</strong> and the Workflow is using an Environment also named <strong>prod</strong>, the Delegate Selector can be <code>${env.name}</code>. This is very useful when you match Delegate Selectors to Application component names such as Environments, Services, etc. It&#39;s also a way to template the Delegate Selector setting.</div><h4>Version Management</h4><div class="note-callout">Currently, this feature is behind the Feature Flag <code>CF_APP_NON_VERSIONING_INACTIVE_ROLLBACK</code>.
