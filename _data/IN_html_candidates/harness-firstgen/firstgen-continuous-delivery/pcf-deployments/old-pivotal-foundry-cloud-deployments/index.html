<div class="note-callout">This tutorial is for the latest version of Harness PCF support. This version is behind a feature flag. To migrate to this version, contact <a href="mailto:support@harness.io" target="_blank">Harness Support</a>.</div><p>Harness provides support for the Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) app development and deployment platform for public and private clouds. This guide describes how to deploy your applications to PCF using Harness, including route mapping.</p><p>Walk through this guide in the following order:</p><ol><li><a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/6m7w43yw4u-overview#deployment_overview">Deployment Overview</a></li><li><a href="/article/0kkyae8347-pcf-delegate-and-connectors">Delegate and Connectors for PCF</a></li><li><a href="/article/s3emmcgotl-services-for-pcf">Services for PCF</a></li><li><a href="/article/ur8gjgayds-pcf-environments">PCF Environments</a></li><li><a href="/article/9ao4gsr93j-pcf-workflows-and-deploy">PCF Workflows and Deployments</a></li><li><a href="/article/6kt564f64q-using-cli-plugins-in-harness-pcf-deployments">Using CLI Plugins in Harness PCF Deployments</a></li></ol><h3>Deployment Overview</h3><div class="note-callout">This tutorial assumes you are familiar with Cloud Foundry and PCF deployments. For a quick overview, see <a href="https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/overview.html" target="_blank">Cloud Foundry Overview</a> and <a href="https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/roles.html" target="_blank">Orgs, Spaces, Roles, and Permissions</a>.</div><p>Setting up a PCF deployment in Harness is a simple process where you connect Harness to your artifact repo and PCF cloud, and then define the app artifacts, PCF manifest files, and target infrastructure.</p><p>Next you build Harness Workflows to deploy your artifacts to the target infrastructure.</p><p>The following list describes the major steps we will cover in this guide:</p><ol><li><strong>Delegate</strong> - Install the Harness <strong>Delegate</strong> on a host in your target VPC, such as an EC2 instance in AWS.</li><li><strong>PCF Cloud Provider</strong> - Add the PCF Cloud Provider. This is a connection to your PCF account. The PCF Cloud Provider uses your user account and the PCF API endpoint address. The PCF user account must have the required roles for the target deployment space.</li><li><strong>Harness Application</strong> - Create the Harness Application for your PCF CD pipeline. The Harness Application represents your PCF release process, and all the building blocks for its pipelines.</li><li><strong>Harness Service</strong> - Create the Harness Service using the <strong>Pivotal Cloud Foundry</strong> type.<ol><li>Set up your PCF artifact source, manifest, and any config variables and files.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Harness Environment</strong> - Create the Harness Environment containing the <a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/n39w05njjv-environment-configuration#add_an_infrastructure_definition">Infrastructure Definition</a> definition of your deployment environment, and any overrides of Service settings.</li><li><strong>Harness Workflow</strong> - Create the Canary or Blue/Green deployment Harness Workflow. This Workflow will deploy the Service (your PCF artifact and manifest) to the Environment.</li><li><strong>Deploy</strong> the Workflow.</li><li>Advanced options not covered in this guide:<ol><li><strong>Harness Pipeline</strong> - Create a Harness Pipeline for your deployment, including Workflows and Approval steps.</li><li><strong>Harness Trigger</strong> - Create a Harness Trigger to automatically deploy your Workflows or Pipeline according to your criteria. Typically, customers use a Trigger to execute a PCF Pipeline using the Trigger&#39;s <strong>On New Artifact</strong> condition. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/xerirloz9a-add-a-trigger-2">Triggers</a>.</li><li><strong>Harness Infrastructure Provisioners</strong> - Create Harness Infrastructure Provisioners, such as CloudFormation and Terraform, for your deployment environments. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/o22jx8amxb-add-an-infra-provisioner">Infrastructure Provisioners</a>.</li><li>Continuous Verification:<ol><li><strong>Deployment Verification</strong> - Once you have successfully deployed you can add your APM and logging apps as Verification Providers, and then add Verify Steps to your Workflows. Harness will use its machine-learning to find anomalies in your deployments. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/myw4h9u05l-verification-providers-list">Continuous Verification</a>.</li><li><strong>24/7 Service Guard</strong> - Monitor your live applications, catching problems that surface minutes or hours following deployment. For more information, see <a href="/article/dajt54pyxd-24-7-service-guard-overview">24/7 Service Guard Overview</a>.</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol><h3>Next Step</h3><ul><li><a href="/article/0kkyae8347-pcf-delegate-and-connectors">1 - Delegate and Connectors for PCF</a></li></ul><p></p>
