  body: '<p>Traditional deployments use application package files and a runtime environment
    (Tomcat, JBoss) in Harness.</p><div class="note-callout">For How-tos on Traditional
    deployments, see <a href="/article/6pwni5f9el-traditional-deployments-overview">Traditional
    (SSH) Deployments How-tos</a>.</div><p>You can perform traditional deployments
    to AWS and Azure, and to any server on any platform via a platform agnostic <a
    href="/article/stkxmb643f-add-physical-data-center-cloud-provider">Physical Data
    Center</a> connection. In all cases, you simply set up a Harness Infrastructure
    Definition and target the hosts on the platform.</p><p>These deployments are different
    from Harness deployments using container orchestration platforms like <a href="/article/7in9z2boh6-kubernetes-quickstart">Kubernetes</a>,
    <a href="/article/2aaevhygep-helm-quickstart">Helm</a>, <a href="/article/hy819vmsux-pivotal-cloud-foundry-quickstart">Pivotal</a>,

    class="note-callout">For a Build and Deploy Pipeline using a Traditional deployment,
    see <a href="/article/0tphhkfqx8-artifact-build-and-deploy-pipelines-overview">Artifact
    Build and Deploy Pipelines Overview</a>.</div><p>Traditional deployments involve
    obtaining an application package from an artifact source, such as a WAR file in
    an AWS S3 bucket, and deploying it to a target host, such as a virtual machine.</p><h3>Supported
    Packaging Formats</h3><p>Harness supports the following traditional deployment
    packaging formats: WAR, JAR, TAR, RPM, ZIP, Docker, and custom files.</p><p>All
    of these formats are also supported by other Harness deployment types, such as
    Kubernetes, Helm, PCF, ECS, etc.  This guide is concerned with traditional deployments
    outside of the container orchestration platforms.</p><h3>Supported Platforms and
    Technologies</h3><p>See <strong>SSH</strong> in <a href="/article/220d0ojx5y-supported-platforms">Supported
    Platforms and Technologies</a>.</p><h3>Deployment Summary</h3><p>For a general
    overview of how Harness works, see <a href="/article/4o7oqwih6h-harness-key-concepts">Harness
    Key Concepts</a>.</p><p>The following list describes the major steps involved
    in a Traditional deployment:</p><ol><li>Installing the Harness Delegate in your
    target infrastructure. See <a href="/article/h9tkwmkrm7-delegate-installation">Harness
    Delegate Overview</a>.</li><li>Add a connection to your artifact server. See <a
    href="/article/nj3p1t7v3x-add-artifactory-servers">Add Artifactory Servers</a>.</li><li>Add
    a connection to your cloud provider. This is a connection to your deployment infrastructure,
    either physical or hosted in a cloud platform like AWS, GCP, or Azure. See <a
    href="/article/whwnovprrb-cloud-providers">Add Cloud Providers</a>.</li><li>Create
    the Harness Application for your deploying your application packages.</li><li>Create
    the Harness Service using the SSH type.<ol><li>Add your packaged application file(s)
    as an Artifact Source.</li></ol></li><li>Create the Harness Environment containing
    the <a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/n39w05njjv-environment-configuration#add_an_infrastructure_definition">Infrastructure
    Definition</a> definition of your deployment infrastructure.</li><li>Create the
    Basic Deployment Workflow.</li><li>Deploy the Workflow.</li><li>Next steps:<ol><li>Create
    a Harness Pipeline for your deployment, including Workflows and Approval steps.
    For more information, see <a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/zc1u96u6uj-pipeline-configuration">Pipelines</a>
    and <a href="/article/0ajz35u2hy-approvals">Approvals</a>.</li><li>Create a Harness
    Trigger to automatically deploy your Workflows or Pipeline according to your criteria.
    For more information, see <a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/xerirloz9a-add-a-trigger-2">Triggers</a>.</li><li>Create
    Harness Infrastructure Provisioners for your deployment environments. For more
