    Switch to <a href="/article/vz5cq0nfg2">NextGen</a>.</div><p>A Trigger involves
    multiple settings, including Service, Environment, and Workflow specifications.
    Harness examines these components as you set up a Trigger.</p><p>You might be
    authorized for one component selected in a Trigger, such as a Service, but not
    another, such as an Environment. In these cases, an error message will alert you
    to missing authorizations.</p><p>To determine if you are authorized to create
    Triggers for a particular Environment or other components, review:</p><ul><li>All
    the permissions of your Harness User Group. The User Group Application Permissions
    should include the <strong>Deployments</strong> Permission Type and <strong>Execute
    Workflow</strong> and/or <strong>Execute Pipeline</strong> Action for the Harness
    Application(s) with the Triggers you want Users to execute.</li><li>The Usage
    Scope of the Cloud Provider, and of any other Harness connectors you have set
    up.</li></ul><p>For further details, see <a href="/article/ven0bvulsj-users-and-permissions">Managing
    Users and Groups (RBAC)</a> and <a href="/article/a7n7lwsjpk-harness-connectors">Connectors
    Overview</a>.</p><p>Below are some errors that can occur.</p><h4>User does not
    have &#34;Deployment: execute&#34; permission</h4><p>Error messages of the form
    <code>User does not have &#34;Deployment: execute&#34; permission</code> indicate
    that your user group&#39;s <strong>Application Permissions</strong> &gt; <strong>Action</strong>
    settings do not include <strong>execute</strong> in the scope of the specified
    Application and/or Environment. To resolve this, see <a href="/article/ven0bvulsj-users-and-permissions#application_permissions">Application
    Permissions</a>.</p><h4>User not authorized</h4><p>The following error message
    indicates that a non-Administrator has tried to submit a Trigger whose <strong>Workflow Variables:
    Environment</strong> field is configured with a variable, rather than with a static
    Environment name:</p><p><code>User not authorized: Only members of the Account
    Administrator user group can create or update  Triggers with parameterized variables</code></p><p>Submitting
    a Pipeline Trigger that includes such a Workflow will generate the same error.</p><p>One
    resolution is to set the <strong>Environment</strong> field to a static value.
    But if the <strong>Environment</strong> setting must be dynamic, a member of the
    Account Administrator user group will need to configure and submit the Trigger.</p><h3>See
    Also</h3><ul><li>You can use settings to enforce authorization on some Triggers.
    See <a href="/article/mc2lxsas4c-trigger-a-deployment-using-c-url">Trigger a Deployment
    using cURL</a>.</li></ul><p></p>'
