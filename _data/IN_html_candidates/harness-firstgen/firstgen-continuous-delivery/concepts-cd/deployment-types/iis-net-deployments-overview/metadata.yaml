  short_version: A summary of Harness IIS (.NET) implementation.
  body: '<p>This topic describes the concept of a Harness IIS (.NET) deployment by
    describing the high-level steps involved.</p><p>For a quick tutorial, see <a href="/article/2oo63r9rwb-iis-net-quickstart">IIS
    (.NET) Quickstart</a>.</p><p>For detailed instructions on using IIS (.NET) in
    Harness, see the <a href="/category/3lkbch7kgn-dotnet-deployments">IIS (.NET)</a>
    How-tos.</p><h3>Before You Begin</h3><p>Before learning about Harness IIS (.NET)
    deployments, you should have an understanding of <a href="/article/4o7oqwih6h-harness-key-concepts">Harness
    Key Concepts</a>.</p><h3>Video Summary</h3><p>Here is a quick primer on deploying
    Microsoft IIS .NET applications and Microsoft .NET Core container applications
    using Harness Continuous Deployment.</p><div class="hd--html"><iframe width="560"
    height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/udWD4LoG_R4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer;
    autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p></p><h3>What
    Does Harness Need Before You Start?</h3><p>A Harness IIS (.NET) deployment requires
    the following:</p><ul><li>Templates: IIS website, application, or virtual directory.
    Harness automatically creates the Deployment Specifications for these templates,
    which you can customize.</li><li>Target infrastructure: For example, an AWS region
    and load balancer or an Azure subscription and resource group.</li></ul><div class="note-callout">It
    is important to note that a site contains one or more applications, an application
    contains one or more virtual directories, and a virtual directory maps to a physical
    directory on a computer. To use Harness to deploy IIS sites, applications, and
    virtual directories, the IIS structural requirements (site &gt; application &gt;
    virtual directory) must be established on the Windows instances.</div><h3>What
    Does Harness Deploy?</h3><p>Harness takes the IIS website, application, or virtual
    directory templates and deployment specifications you provide, and creates an
    IIS website, application, or virtual directory in your target infrastructure.</p><p>You
    can create a Harness Pipeline that runs three Workflows to deploy the IIS website,
    application, or virtual directory in succession.</p><h3>What Does a Harness IIS
    (.NET) Deployment Involve?</h3><p>The following list describes the major steps
    of a Harness IIS (.NET) deployment:</p><p></p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Step</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Name</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Description
    and Links</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>Install the Harness
    <strong>Delegate</strong> in your target infrastructure, such as an EC2 subnet.</p></td><td><p>Typically,
    the Shell Script or ECS Delegate is installed in the same subnet where you will
    deploy your application(s).</p><p>For Azure deployments, you can run the Delegate
    on a Linux VM in your Azure VPC (such as Ubuntu) or simply ensure that the Delegate
    has network access to resources in your Azure VPC</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>Add
    a Harness <strong>Artifact Server</strong>.</p></td><td><p>Add a connection to
    the Artifact Server where Harness can pull the IIS website, application, or virtual
    directory template.</p><p>If you are using the same Cloud Provider as artifact
    server, then you can skip this step.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>Add
    a <strong>Cloud Provider</strong>.</p></td><td><p>A Cloud Provider is a connection
    to your cloud platform account, such as AWS or Azure. You can also connect to
    a physical server.</p><p>For example, an AWS Cloud Provider can be used to connect
    to S3 and obtain the IIS templates Harness will use to create new website, application,
    or virtual directory templates.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>Create
    the Harness <strong>Application</strong> for your IIS (.NET) CD Pipeline.</p></td><td><p>The
    Harness Application represents a group of microservices/apps, their deployment
    pipelines, and all the building blocks for those pipelines. Harness represents
    your release process using a logical group of one or more entities: Services,
    Environments, Workflows, Pipelines, Triggers, and Infrastructure Provisioners.
    Applications organize all of the entities and configurations in Harness CD.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>5</p></td><td><p>Create
    the Harness <strong>Service</strong> using the <strong>Windows Remote Management
    (WinRM)</strong> Deployment Type.</p></td><td><p>Add an IIS website, application,
    or virtual directory template in a Harness Service, revise the Deployment Specification,
    and any config variables and files.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>6</p></td><td><p>Create
    the Harness <strong>Environment</strong> and Infrastructure Definition for your
    deployment, and any overrides.</p></td><td><p>Using the Harness Cloud Provider
    you set up, you can select the target environment for your deployment.</p><p>You
    can also override any Service settings. This enables you to use a single Service
    with multiple Harness Environments.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>7</p></td><td><p>Create
    the Website, Application, and Virtual Directory deployments in Harness Basic <strong>Workflows</strong>.</p></td><td><p>The
    Workflow deploys the Website, Application, and Virtual Directory templates defined
    in the Harness Service to the environment in the Harness Infrastructure Definition.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>8</p></td><td><p>Deploy
    the Workflow.</p></td><td><p>Once you&#39;ve deployed a Workflow, learn how to
    improve your IIS (.NET) CD:</p><ul><li><a href="/article/m220i1tnia-workflow-configuration">Workflows</a></li><li><a
    href="/article/xerirloz9a-add-a-trigger-2">Triggers</a></li><li><a href="/article/o22jx8amxb-add-an-infra-provisioner">Infrastructure
    Provisioners Overview</a></li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Next Steps</h3><p>Read
    the following topics to build on what you&#39;ve learned:</p><ul><li><a href="/article/2oo63r9rwb-iis-net-quickstart">IIS
    (.NET) Quickstart</a></li><li><a href="/category/3lkbch7kgn-dotnet-deployments">IIS
