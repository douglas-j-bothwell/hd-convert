Switch to <a href="/article/n06yruxm0d">NextGen</a>.</div><p>This topic lists the deployment log size, export, and viewing limits.</p><h3>Limitations</h3><p>Harness deployment logging has the following limitations:</p><ul><li>A hard limit of 25MB for logs produced by 1 Workflow step. Logs beyond this limit will be skipped and not available for download as well.</li><li>Harness always saves the final log line that contains the status (Success, Failure, etc) even if logs go beyond the limit.</li><li>In cases where the final log line is itself very large and logs are already beyond max limit (25MB), Harness shows a limited portion of the line from the end (10KB of data for the log line).</li></ul><h3>Viewing Large Logs</h3><p>For any completed Workflow displayed in <strong>Deployments</strong>, you can expand the log section. The most recent log information is displayed first. You can scroll to see older logs information.</p><h3>See Also</h3><p><a href="/article/pe7vgjs6sv-export-deployment-logs">Export Deployment Logs</a></p>
