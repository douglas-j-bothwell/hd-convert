    Switch to <a href="/article/n06yruxm0d">NextGen</a>.</div><p>This topic lists
    the deployment log size, export, and viewing limits.</p><h3>Limitations</h3><p>Harness
    deployment logging has the following limitations:</p><ul><li>A hard limit of 25MB
    for logs produced by 1 Workflow step. Logs beyond this limit will be skipped and
    not available for download as well.</li><li>Harness always saves the final log
    line that contains the status (Success, Failure, etc) even if logs go beyond the
    limit.</li><li>In cases where the final log line is itself very large and logs
    are already beyond max limit (25MB), Harness shows a limited portion of the line
    from the end (10KB of data for the log line).</li></ul><h3>Viewing Large Logs</h3><p>For
    any completed Workflow displayed in <strong>Deployments</strong>, you can expand
    the log section. The most recent log information is displayed first. You can scroll
    to see older logs information.</p><h3>See Also</h3><p><a href="/article/pe7vgjs6sv-export-deployment-logs">Export
