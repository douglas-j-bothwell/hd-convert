    They can also target physical servers. Harness supports connecting and deploying
    to all target types.</p><p>This topic covers the steps needed to connect Harness
    to your artifact servers and target environments.</p><p>In this topic:</p><ul><li><a

    Delegate Overview</a></li><li><a href="/article/4o7oqwih6h-harness-key-concepts">Harness
    Key Concepts</a></li></ul><p></p><h3>Step 1: Set Up a Harness Delegate</h3><p>The
    Delegate needs to be able to connect to the artifact server or repository containing
    the file, and the target host where the file will be deployed. Typically, the
    Delegate is installed on a host in the same subnet as the target host.</p><p>For
    steps on installing the Delegate, see <a href="/article/h9tkwmkrm7-delegate-installation">Harness
    Delegate Overview</a>.</p><p>For AWS, you can install the Delegate on an EC2 instance
    and then have the Harness Cloud Provider assume the IAM role used by the Delegate
    host. For more information, see Delegate Selectors in <a href="/article/c3fvixpgsl-select-delegates-for-specific-tasks-with-selectors">Select
    Delegates for Specific Tasks with Selectors</a>.</p><h3>Step 2: Connect to Your
    Artifact Server</h3><p>Harness retrieves the package file from an artifact source
    using a Harness Artifact Server and deploys it to the target host using a Cloud
    Provider. </p><p>See <a href="/article/7dghbx1dbl-configuring-artifact-server">Add
    Artifact Servers</a>.</p><h3>Step 3: Connect to Your Cloud Provider or Physical
    Server</h3><p>You connect Harness to the target environment for your deployment.
    This can be a VM in the cloud or a physical server.</p><p>See <a href="/article/whwnovprrb-cloud-providers">Add
    Cloud Providers</a> and <a href="/article/stkxmb643f-add-physical-data-center-cloud-provider">Add
    Physical Data Center as Cloud Provider</a>.</p><h3>Configure As Code</h3><p>To
    see how to configure the settings in this topic using YAML, configure the settings
    in the UI first, and then click the YAML editor button (<span style="color:#fb9e00"
