  body: <p>The following topics discuss how to perform Traditional deployments using
    application package files and a runtime environment (Tomcat, JBoss) in Harness.</p><p>These
    deployments are different from Harness deployments using container orchestration
    platforms like <a href="/article/7in9z2boh6-kubernetes-quickstart">Kubernetes</a>,
    <a href="/article/2aaevhygep-helm-quickstart">Helm</a>, <a href="/article/hy819vmsux-pivotal-cloud-foundry-quickstart">Pivotal</a>,
    <a href="/article/j39azkrevm-aws-ecs-deployments">AWS ECS</a>, and <a href="/article/kiuft72fr5-azure-deployments-overview">Azure</a>.</p><p>Traditional
    deployments involve obtaining an application package from an artifact source,
    such as a WAR file in an AWS S3 bucket, and deploying it to a target host, such
    an AWS AMI.</p><p>For an overview, see <a href="/article/aig5tw1zvo-traditional-deployments-ssh-overview">Traditional
