Contact <a href="mailto:support@harness.io" target="_blank">Harness Support</a> to enable the feature. Feature Flags can only be removed for Harness Professional and Essentials editions. Once the feature is released to a general audience, it&#39;s available for Trial and Community Editions.<br/><br/>See <a href="https://changelog.harness.io/?categories=fix,improvement,new" target="_blank">New features added to Harness</a> and <a href="https://changelog.harness.io/?categories=early-access" target="_blank">Features behind Feature Flags</a> (Early Access) for Feature Flag information.</div><p></p><p>For <strong>Text</strong> and <strong>Email</strong> types, in <strong>Allowed Values</strong>, you can enter multiple options by separating them by commas.</p><p>For example:</p><p></p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/articles/766iheu1bk/1623092025243/image.png"/></figure><p>When you deploy the Workflow, the values appear as a dropdown, with the Default Value already selected:</p><p></p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/articles/766iheu1bk/1623092070324/image.png"/></figure><p>The same options will be available when the Workflow is used in a Pipeline and Trigger.</p><p>You can also search for values by simply entering the search values in the dropdown.</p><p>When you type into the dropdown to search for Allowed Values, be sure to select one or more values and not hit Enter. If you hit Enter, your search term will be used and if it is not exactly the same as an Allowed Value, it will fail during execution.</p><h3>Review: Using a Workflow Variable across Pipeline Stages</h3><p>If you use Workflow variables with the same name across a Pipeline&#39;s stages, the Workflow variables will always have the same value. The value is assigned when the first instance of the variable is evaluated at runtime.</p><p>When Harness runs a Pipeline, it will encounter the Workflow variable in the first stage where it is used. Harness will resolve that variable to a value. Each subsequent use the a Workflow variable with the same name in the same Pipeline will now also use that value.</p><p>It&#39;s important to understand how Workflow variables with the same name work in a Pipeline because you might want to change the value of the Workflow from stage to stage. But Harness will not do this because it only resolves the variable once and then uses that value for each instance of the Workflow variable with the same name.</p><h3>Step: Add Workflow Variables</h3><p>To use Workflow variables, do the following:</p><ol><li>In a Workflow, click the pencil icon next to <strong>Workflow Variables</strong>. The <strong>Workflow Variables</strong> dialog appears.</li></ol><p></p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/articles/766iheu1bk/1589820316249/image.png" style="max-height:50%;max-width:50%" data-hd-height="50%" data-hd-width="50%"/></figure><p><strong>Workflow Variables</strong> have the following settings.</p><p></p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Field</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Description</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Variable Name</strong></p></td><td><p>Enter a name for the variable.
