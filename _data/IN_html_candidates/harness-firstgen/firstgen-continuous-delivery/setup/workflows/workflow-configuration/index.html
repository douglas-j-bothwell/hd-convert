<p>Workflows define the deployment orchestration steps, including how a Service is deployed, verified, rolled back, and more. Some of the common Workflow types are Canary, Blue/Green, and Rolling. An Application might have different deployment orchestration steps for different Environments, each managed in a Workflow.</p><p>If you&#39;re looking for Workflow How-tos, see the following:</p><ul><li> <a href="/article/o86qyexcab-tags-how-tos">Add a Workflow</a></li><li> <a href="/article/5ffpvrohi3-deploy-a-workflow">Deploy Individual Workflow</a></li><li> <a href="/article/mec513o1oc-verify-workflow-new-template">Verify Workflow</a></li><li> <a href="/article/duu0gbhejn-add-notification-strategy-new-template">Add a Workflow Notification Strategy</a></li><li> <a href="/article/vfp0ksdzg3-define-workflow-failure-strategy-new-template">Define Workflow Failure Strategy</a></li><li> <a href="/article/766iheu1bk-add-workflow-variables-new-template">Set Workflow Variables</a></li><li> <a href="/article/oq0p41g19m-add-steps-for-different-tasks-in-a-wor-kflow">Use Steps for Different Workflow Tasks</a></li><li> <a href="/article/nq3ugixwle-add-workflow-phase-new-template">Add Phases to a Workflow</a></li><li> <a href="/article/7tg1s7du0d-synchronize-workflows-in-your-pipeline-using-barrier">Synchronize Workflows in your Pipeline Using Barrier</a></li><li> <a href="/article/bov41f5b7o-templatize-a-workflow-new-template">Templatize a Workflow</a></li><li> <a href="/article/teg9oq8e59-clone-a-workflow">Clone a Workflow</a></li><li> <a href="/article/0svkm9v7vr-configure-workflow-using-yaml">Configure Workflow Using YAML</a></li></ul><h3>Before You Begin</h3><p>Before learning about workflows, you should have an understanding of the following:</p><ul><li> <a href="/article/bucothemly-application-configuration">Application Components</a></li><li> <a href="/article/eb3kfl8uls-service-configuration">Add a Service</a></li><li> <a href="/article/n39w05njjv-environment-configuration">Add an Environment</a></li></ul><h3>Workflow Types</h3><div class="note-callout">If you are new to deployment strategies, read <a href="/article/325x7awntc-deployment-concepts-and-strategies">Deployment Concepts and Strategies</a> to learn about common deployment strategies.

When the Workflow is deployed, the user must provide values for the settings you have defined as variables.</p><div class="note-callout">When you turn a Workflow into a template, if the Workflow still retains references to the entities it was originally created with (such as a Service), any attempts to delete these entities will result in an error, because the template is still using them. You will need to remove the references from the template before you can delete them.</div><h4>Workflow Templates and Service Types</h4><p>The Workflow template only works with Services using the same Deployment and Artifact Type as the Service used to create the Workflow. This applies to Services of Deployment Type <strong>Secure Shell (SSH)</strong>.</p><p>For example, let&#39;s say you created a Workflow using a Service with the Deployment Type <strong>Secure Shell (SSH)</strong> and Artifact Type <strong>JAR</strong>. If you have another Service with the same Deployment Type, but the Artifact Type is <strong>WAR</strong>, the Workflow template will not show it as an option during deployment.</p><h4>Templatize Phases in Canary Workflows</h4><p>For Canary Workflows, you edit the Phase settings and click the <strong>[T]</strong> next to <strong>Service</strong>. The <strong>[T]</strong> was automatically selected for <strong>Infrastructure Definition</strong> when you clicked the <strong>[T]</strong> for <strong>Environment</strong>.</p><p></p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/articles/m220i1tnia/1579541375003/image.png"/></figure><h4>Templatized Workflows in Pipelines</h4><p>Once you have templatized a Workflow, you can use it in multiple stages of a pipeline.</p><p>For example, you can templatize the <strong>Environment</strong> and <strong>Infrastructure Definition</strong> of a Workflow, and then use the same Workflow for both the QA and Production stages of a Pipeline. When you add the Workflow to each stage, you simply provide QA and Production-specific values for <strong>Environment</strong> and <strong>Infrastructure Definition</strong> variables.</p><p></p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Workflow Variables in QA Stage of Pipeline</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Workflow Variables in Production Stage of Pipeline</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p></p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/other/1568241468648/image.png"/></figure></td><td><p></p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/other/1568241445999/image.png"/></figure></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3>Workflow Phases</h3><p>In multi-phase deployments, such as a Canary Deployment, Workflow steps are grouped into phases. Here is a Canary Workflow before the phases and sub-steps are added:</p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/articles/m220i1tnia/1533163433143/canary-phases-no-steps.png"/></figure><div class="note-callout">You cannot run a Workflow&#39;s phases in parallel. Consider using multiple Workflows.</div><h3>Barriers</h3><p>When deploying interdependent services, such as microservices or a large and complicated application, there might be a need to coordinate the timing of the different components&#39; deployments. A common example is the need to verify a group of services only after <em>all the services</em> are deployed successfully.</p><p>Harness Workflows address this scenario using barriers. Barriers allow you to synchronize different Workflows in your Pipeline, and control the flow of your deployment systematically.</p><p>Barriers have an effect only when two or more Workflows use the same barrier name, and are executed in parallel in a Pipeline. When executed in parallel, both Workflows will cross the barrier at the same time.</p><p>If a Workflow fails before reaching its barrier point, the Workflow signals the other Workflows that have the same barrier, and the other Workflows will react as if they failed as well. At that point, each Workflow will act according to its <a href="#failure_strategies">Failure Strategy</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/articles/qm2u5fc10e/1532028637582/barrier-flow.png"/></figure><p></p><p>For more information on how to synchronize your Workflows using Barriers, see <a href="/article/7tg1s7du0d-synchronize-workflows-in-your-pipeline-using-barrier">Synchronize Workflows in your Pipeline Using Barriers</a>.</p><h3>Rollback Steps</h3><p>You define the steps of a Workflow rollback in <strong>Rollback Steps</strong>. Typically you want to rollback failed containers and container orchestration setup. You can also verify that the rollback has restored the last working version of your Service.</p><p>Harness performs rollback differently depending on the target platform (deployment type), deployment strategy, and the steps where you can configure how we handle old versions. See <a href="/article/v41e8oo00e-kubernetes-rollback">Kubernetes Rollback</a> and <a href="/article/d7rnemtfuz-ecs-rollback">ECS Rollbacks</a> as examples.</p><p>In general, during a successful deployment, Harness deletes all old versions of the deployed service except for the last successfully deployed version. This version is kept for rollback. If rollback occurs, Harness restores the last successful version but not the older versions it deleted.</p><p>For Docker, Kubernetes, AWS CodeDeploy, and Lambda deployments, Harness rolls back the deployment to the state that received the new code.</p><p>In case of a JAR, WAR, RPM, TAR, ZIP and other deployments, Harness provides default rollback steps (Disable, Stop, Deploy, Enable, Wrap-up). You can add custom commands in cases where you need to customize the rollback procedure.</p><div class="note-callout">If you deploy a Workflow and choose the <strong>Abort</strong> option during the running deployment, the Rollback Steps for the Workflow are not executed. Abort stops the deployment execution without rollback or cleanup. To execute the Rollback Steps, click the <strong>Rollback</strong> button.</div><div class="tip-callout">For post-production rollback, see <a href="/article/2f36rsbrve-post-deployment-rollback">Rollback Production Deployments</a>.</div><p>To set up rollback steps, do the following:</p><ol><li>In a Workflow, click <strong>Rollback Steps</strong> to see the default steps. Here is an example of the default rollback steps in a Workflow that deploys a Docker image to a Kubernetes cluster:<figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/articles/m220i1tnia/1533231344346/rollback-steps-default.png"/></figure></li></ol><h3>Notification Strategy</h3><p>By default, when a Workflow fails, the Account Administrator is notified. You can specify a notification strategy for a Workflow (or for a Workflow phase in a Canary or Multi-Service Workflow) that sends notifications using different criteria.</p><p>See <a href="/article/duu0gbhejn-add-notification-strategy-new-template">Add a Workflow Notification Strategy</a>.</p><h3>Failure Strategies</h3><p>A Failure Strategy defines how your Workflow handles different failure conditions. For example, if you are deploying a Service to a cluster of 100 nodes, what percentage of connectivity errors would you allow before failing the deployment?</p><p>There are two ways to define a failure strategy:</p><ul><li>The <strong>Failure Strategy</strong> settings for the entire Workflow.<figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/other/1569946262821/image.png"/></figure></li><li>Step-level failure strategy for a Workflow step section.<figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/other/1569946292763/image.png"/></figure></li></ul><p>See <a href="/article/vfp0ksdzg3-define-workflow-failure-strategy-new-template">Define Workflow Failure Strategy</a>.</p><h3>Concurrency Strategy</h3><p>You can edit a Workflow&#39;s <strong>Concurrency Strategy</strong> section to override Harness&#39; default <a href="/article/hui1k7seo1-workflow-queuing">Workflow queuing</a> behavior.
