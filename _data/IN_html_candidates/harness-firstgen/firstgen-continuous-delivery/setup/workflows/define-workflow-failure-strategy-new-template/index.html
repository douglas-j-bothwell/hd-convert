The step-level settings appear.<figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/articles/vfp0ksdzg3/1617138352227/image.png"/></figure></li><li>In <strong>Failure Strategy</strong>, click <strong>Custom</strong>.

Contact <a href="mailto:support@harness.io" target="_blank">Harness Support</a> to enable the feature.</div><p>During workflow execution, if a Delegate goes down, the tasks are marked as failed. With the Delegate Error condition, you can identify such situations faster and retrigger the steps. A Delegate times out if it fails to send heartbeats within 3 minutes. You can apply a failure strategy in such scenarios and retrigger the tasks.</p><h3>Review: Multiple Failure Strategies in a Workflow</h3><p>When using multiple Failure Strategies in a Workflow, consider the following:</p><ul><li>For failure strategies that do not overlap (different types of failures selected), they will behave as expected.</li><li>Two failures cannot occur at the same time, so whichever error occurs, that Failure Strategy will be used.</li></ul><h4>Conflicts</h4><p>Conflicts might arise between failure strategies on the same level or different levels. By <em>level</em>, we mean the step-level or the Workflow level:</p><p></p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/articles/vfp0ksdzg3/1591895038109/image.png"/></figure><h5>Same level</h5><p>If there is a conflict between multiple failures in strategies on the same level, the first applicable strategy is used, and the remaining strategies are ignored.</p><p>For example, consider these two strategies:</p><ol><li>Abort Workflow on Verification Failure or Authentication Failure.</li><li>Ignore on Verification Failure or Connectivity Error.</li></ol><p>Here&#39;s what will happen:</p><ul><li>On a verification failure, the Workflow is aborted.</li><li>On an authentication failure, the Workflow is aborted.</li><li>On a connectivity error, the error is ignored.</li></ul><h5>Different levels</h5><p>If there is a clash of selected failures in strategies on different levels, the step-level strategy will be used and the Workflow level strategy will be ignored.</p><p></p>
