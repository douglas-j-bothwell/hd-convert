  body: <div class="note-callout">Infrastructure Definition replaces Service Infrastructure
    as the method for defining your target infrastructure. Currently, Infrastructure
    Definition is behind a feature flag. Contact Harness Support to migrate to Infrastructure
    Definitions.</div><p>The Service Infrastructure for an Environment is where you
    specify a deployment infrastructure, using a Cloud Provider you added in <a href="/article/whwnovprrb-infrastructure-providers">Add
    Cloud Providers</a>, a deployment type, such Kubernetes, and the specific infrastructure
    details for the deployment, like VPC settings.</p><p>To add a Service Infrastructure,
    do the following:</p><div class="note-callout">This example covers platforms that
    use clusters, such as Kubernetes and ECS, but the steps are similar for other
    platforms.</div><ol><li>In an Application, open an Environment.</li><li>In <strong>Service
    Infrastructure</strong>, click <strong>Add Service Infrastructure</strong>. The
    <strong>Service Infrastructure</strong> dialog appears.<figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/articles/n39w05njjv/1533076560722/service-infra-dialo.png"
    style="max-height:80%;max-width:80%" data-hd-height="80%" data-hd-width="80%"/></figure></li><li>In
    <strong>Service</strong>, click the name of the Service that will deploy to this
    Environment.</li><li>In <strong>Deployment Type</strong>, click a deployment type
    such as Kubernetes.</li><li>In <strong>Cloud Provider</strong>, click the cloud
    provider where you will deploy the service.</li><li>Click <strong>Next</strong>.
    Harness will retrieve the cluster information from the cloud provider you selected.</li><li>In
    <strong>Cluster Name</strong>, click the name of the cluster where you want to
    deploy the service.</li><li>In <strong>Namespace</strong>, select the name of
    the cluster namespace.</li><li>Click <strong>SUBMIT</strong>. The infrastructure
    is listed under <strong>Service Infrastructure</strong>.</li></ol><p>For some
    Service Infrastructures, you will need to select VPC details and enter <strong>Connection
    Attributes</strong>. Connection Attributes are SSH keys used to connect to hosts
    in the VPC. This authentication is different from that performed by the Cloud
    Provider you select, which is used for API communication.</p><p>Connection Attributes
    use SSH keys set up in Harness Secrets. For more information, see <a href="/article/au38zpufhr-secret-management">Secrets
    Management</a>.</p><div class="note-callout">For information about how a Service
    Infrastructure is used in specific deployments, see <a href="/article/i3n6qr8p5i-deployments-overview">Deployments
    Overview</a>.</div><h3>Next Steps</h3><p>??</p>
