  title: Trigger Workflows and Pipelines
  description: Triggers allow you to execute a Workflow or Pipeline automatically,

  body: <p>Triggers automate deployments using a variety of conditions, such as Git
    events, new artifacts, schedules, and the success of other Pipelines.</p><div
    class="note-callout">To trigger Workflows and Pipeline using the Harness GraphQL
    API, see <a href="/article/s3leksekny-trigger-workflow-or-a-pipeline-using-api">Trigger
    Workflows or Pipelines Using GraphQL API</a>.</div><p>You can always execute a
    Workflow or Pipeline manually, and a Trigger does not change any approval requirements
    in a Workflow or Pipeline.</p><p>When you configure a Trigger, you set the condition
    that executes the Trigger, whether to execute a Workflow or Pipeline, and then
    the specific actions of the Trigger, such as what artifact source to use.</p><p>For
