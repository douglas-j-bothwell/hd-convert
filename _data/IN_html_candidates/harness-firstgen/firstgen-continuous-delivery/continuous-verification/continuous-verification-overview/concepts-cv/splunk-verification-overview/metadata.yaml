  body: <p></p><p>This topic describes how to set up Harness Continuous Verification
    features, and monitor your deployments and production applications using its unsupervised
    machine-learning functionality, on Splunk.</p><p>In this topic:</p><ul><li><a

    Process Summary</a></li><li><a href="#next_steps">Next Steps</a></li></ul><p></p><h3>Visual
    Summary</h3><p>Splunk Enterprise enables you to search, analyze, and visualize
    data gathered from your microservices, websites, and apps. After you define the
    data source, Splunk Enterprise indexes the data stream and parses it into a series
    of individual events that you can view and search. Splunk provides a REST API
    with over 200 endpoints. Developers can programmatically index, search, and visualize
    data in Splunk from any app.</p><p>Harness Continuous Verification integrates
    with Splunk to verify your deployments and live production applications using
    the following Harness features:</p><ul><li><strong>24/7 Service Guard</strong>-
    Monitors your live, production applications.</li><li><strong>Deployment Verification</strong>-
    Monitors your application deployments, and performs automatic rollback according
    to your criteria.</li></ul><p>This document describes how to set up these Harness
    Continuous Verification features and monitor your deployments and production applications
    using its unsupervised machine-learning functionality.</p><p>For example, once
    you have integrated Splunk with your microservice or app, you can add a Splunk
    verification step to your Harness workflows and Harness will use Splunk to verify
    the performance and quality of your deployments and apply Harness machine-learning
    verification analysis to Splunk data.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Verification

    Monitor your application using Splunk. In this article, we assume that you are
    using Splunk to monitor your application already.</li><li><strong>​Verification
    Provider Setup</strong> - In Harness, you connect Harness to your Splunk account,
    adding Splunk as a <strong>Harness Verification Provider</strong>.</li><li><strong>Harness
    Application</strong> - Create a Harness Application with a Service and an Environment.
    We do not cover Application setup in this sequence. See <a href="/article/bucothemly-application-configuration">Create
    an Application</a>.</li><li><strong>​24/7 Service Guard Setup</strong> <strong>-</strong> In
    the Environment, set up 24/7 Service Guard to monitor your live, production application.</li><li>​<strong>Verify
    Deployments</strong>:<ol><li>Add a Workflow to your Harness Application and deploy
    your microservice or application to the service infrastructure/<a href="https://docs.harness.io/article/n39w05njjv-environment-configuration#add_an_infrastructure_definition">Infrastructure
    Definition</a> in your Environment.</li><li>After you have run a successful deployment,
    you then add verification steps to the Workflow using your Verification Provider.</li><li>Harness
    uses unsupervised machine-learning and Splunk analytics to analyze your future
    deployments, discovering events that might be causing your deployments to fail.
    Then you can use this information to set rollback criteria and improve your deployments.</li></ol></li></ol><p></p><h3>Next
