Detecting and investigating regressions and anomalies across these tools consumes a lot of time. For those of you tasked with monitoring microservices, the following image will be familiar.</p><p></p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/articles/l5ky4p140j/1544641823675/image.png"/></figure><p>Harness solves this problem with Harness 24/7 Service Guard.</p><p></p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/articles/l5ky4p140j/1544644853397/image.png"/></figure><p>Harness 24/7 Service Guard:</p><ul><li>Collects all of your monitoring and verification tools into a single dashboard.</li><li>Applies Harness Continuous Verification unsupervised machine-learning to detect regressions and anomalies across transactions and events.</li><li>Lets you drill down to the individual issue and open it in the related tool.</li></ul><p>Harness 24/7 Service Guard gives DevOps operational visibility across all your monitoring tools in all your production environments.</p><p></p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/articles/dajt54pyxd/1578089850395/image.png"/></figure><p>24/7 Service Guard&#39;s automatic anomaly and regression detection allows you to see when end users are impactedâ€”without requiring configuration, thresholds (which you can <a href="#alert_notifications">optionally add</a>), or rules.</p><h3>Combined with Workflow Verifications</h3><p>24/7 Service Guard is an addition to Harness&#39; basic deployment verification functionality, which is described in <a href="/article/myw4h9u05l-verification-providers-list">Continuous Verification</a>. Harness Workflow verification steps provide verification of Harness deployments and the running microservice for the first 15-30 minutes. 24/7 Service Guard provides detection of your microservices from then on, catching problems that surface minutes or hours following deployment.</p><p>The following image shows how the Continuous Verification dashboard includes both 24/7 Service Guard and Harness Deployments verification.</p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/articles/l5ky4p140j/1544751236023/image.png"/></figure><ol><li>24/7 Service Guard detection.</li><li>Harness Deployments verification.</li></ol><div class="note-callout">For 24/7 Service Guard, the queries you define to collect logs are specific to the application or service you want monitored. Verification is at the application/service level. This is unlike Workflows, where verification is performed at the host/node/pod level.</div><h3>Machine Learning Overview</h3><p>24/7 Service Guard sits on top of all your Application Performance Monitoring (APM), verification, and logging tools. 24/7 Service Guard applies:</p><ul><li>Predictive machine learning models for short-term behavior:<ul><li>Applies deep neural nets to short-term history.</li><li>Detects unusual patterns due to spikes.</li><li>Adapts to drift over deployments.</li></ul></li><li>Applies memory models for long term behavior:<ul><li>Learns historical/cyclical trends.</li><li>Quantifies app reliability over Web and business transactions, based on the history of anomalous behavior.</li><li>Quantifies the importance of different Web and business transactions, based on app usage over short- and long-term periods.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Video Demonstration</h3><p>Here&#39;s a 2-minute video that explains Harness 24/7 Service Guard:</p><p></p><div class="hd--embed" data-provider="Wistia" data-thumbnail=""><iframe src="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/izo4qehiuu" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="wistia_embed" name="wistia_embed" allowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" webkitallowfullscreen="" oallowfullscreen="" msallowfullscreen="" width="620" height="349"></iframe><script src="//fast.wistia.net/assets/external/E-v1.js" async=""></script></div><h3>Using the Dashboard</h3><p>To use 24/7 Service Guard, click Harness Manager&#39;s <strong>Continuous Verification</strong> link.</p><p></p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/articles/l5ky4p140j/1544637188038/image.png" style="max-height:17%;max-width:17%" data-hd-height="17%" data-hd-width="17%"/></figure><p>The Services configured with 24/7 Service Guard appear. In this example, we have two applications:</p><p></p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/articles/dajt54pyxd/1578089964757/image.png"/></figure><p>Let&#39;s look at the dashboard in detail. The following image describes the 24/7 Service Guard dashboard for the application.</p><p></p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/articles/dajt54pyxd/1578089995280/image.png"/></figure><ol><li><strong>Monitoring sources:</strong> Verification and metrics providers, such as AppDynamics, etc. For a list of the verification providers supported by Harness, see <a href="/article/myw4h9u05l-verification-providers-list">Continuous Verification</a>.</li><li><strong>Heat map:</strong> The heat map is generated using the application and the monitoring sources. Each square is a time segment.</li><li><strong>Time resolution:</strong> You can go high-level (for example, 30 days) or low-level (12 hours).</li><li><strong>Performance regressions:</strong> Red and yellow are used to highlight regressions and anomalies. The colors indicate the Overall Risk Level for the monitoring segment.</li><li><strong>Transactions analysis:</strong> Click a square to see the machine-learning details for the monitoring segment. The analysis details show the transactions for the monitoring segment. High-risk transactions are listed first.</li><li><strong>Drill-in to find the cause of the regression or anomaly:</strong> When you click the dot for a transaction, you get further details and you can click a link to open the transaction in the monitoring tool. This allows you to go into the monitoring tool and find the root cause of the regression (specific queries, events, etc).</li></ol><h3>Next Step</h3><ul><li><a href="/article/zrwsldxn94-set-up-service-guard">Set Up 24/7 Service Guard</a></li></ul><p></p>
