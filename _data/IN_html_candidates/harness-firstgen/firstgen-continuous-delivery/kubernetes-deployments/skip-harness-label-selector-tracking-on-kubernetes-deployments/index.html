<div class="note-callout">Currently, this feature is behind the feature flag <code>SKIP_ADDING_TRACK_LABEL_SELECTOR_IN_ROLLING</code>. Contact <a href="mailto:support@harness.io" target="_blank">Harness Support</a> to enable the feature.</div><p>You can prevent Harness from using its default Kubernetes label selector <code>harness.io/track: stable</code> during Canary deployments. Skipping this label can help when you have existing non-Harness deployed services or conflicts in naming.</p><h3>Review: Labels in Harness Kubernetes Canary Phases</h3><p>Default Harness Kubernetes Canary deployments are a two phase process that relies on Deployment object labels for tracking. </p><p>First, let&#39;s review the two phase Canary deployment:</p><ol><li><strong>Canary Phase:</strong> <ol><li>Harness creates a Canary version of the Kubernetes Deployment object defined in your Service Definition <strong>Manifests</strong> section.</li><li>All pods in the Canary Phase have label the <code>harness.io/track: canary</code>. Traffic could be routed to these pods using this label.</li><li>Once that Deployment is verified, the Canary Delete step deletes it by default.<br/>Using this method, Harness provides a Canary group as a way to test the new build, run your verification, and then roll out to the following Primary group.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Primary Phase:</strong> <ol><li>Runs the actual Deployment using a Kubernetes Rolling Update with the number of pods you specify in the <strong>Manifests</strong> files (for example, <code>replicas: 3</code>).</li><li>All pods in the Primary Phase have label <code>harness.io/track: stable</code>.</li></ol></li></ol><h3>Review: Invalid Value LabelSelector</h3><p>Kubernetes labels are immutable. If a specific Deployment object already exists in the cluster, you cannot change its labels.</p><p>This can cause problems with the default Harness Kubernetes Canary deployments use of <code>harness.io/track</code> if the Deployment object already exists before the Harness deployment.</p><p>If you are deploying different Harness Deployment objects to the same cluster, you might encounter a Selector error such as this:</p><pre>The Deployment “harness-example-deployment” is invalid: spec.selector: <br/>  Invalid value: v1.LabelSelector{MatchLabels:map[string]string{“app”:“harness-example”}, <br/>  MatchExpressions:[]v1.LabelSelectorRequirement{}}: field is immutable</pre><p></p><p>Most often, you can simply delete or rename the Deployment object. In some case, this can be a problem because you will have downtime when the object is restarted.</p><p>As an alternative, you can force Harness to skip the <code>harness.io/track: stable</code> label in the Canary deployment.</p><h3>Skipping the Tracking Label</h3><p>Once the relevant feature flag is enabled, a Harness Kubernetes Canary deployment will work like this:</p><ul><li>If the Deployment object already exists in the cluster <u>without</u> the <code>harness.io/track: stable</code>, Harness will not add the <code>harness.io/track: stable</code> label to the Deployment object.</li><li>If the Deployment object already exists <u>with</u> the <code>harness.io/track: stable</code> label, Harness will not delete it.</li><li>For any <u>new</u> Deployment object, Harness will not add the <code>harness.io/track: stable</code> label.</li></ul><p></p><p> </p><p> </p>
