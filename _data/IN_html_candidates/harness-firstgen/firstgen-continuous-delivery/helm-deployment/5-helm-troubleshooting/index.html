Do the following:</p><ul><li>Verify that Helm is installed.</li><li>Check if the Git connector being used in the Workflow and the Delegate can connect to the Git repo. Check in the Delegate logs for Git connectivity issues.</li></ul><h3>Helm Install/Upgrade Failed</h3><p>Likely, there is an incompatible Helm client or Tiller. The Helm client needs to be lesser or equal to the Tiller version:</p><p></p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/articles/zmrvylwqds/1553543763944/image.png"/></figure><p>To fix this, upgrade Tiller:</p><p><code>helm init --upgrade</code></p><h3>First Helm Deployment Goes to Upgrade Path</h3><p>In some cases, the first Helm deployment goes to the upgrade path even though the Helm version is working fine.</p><p>This is the result of a Helm issue: <a href="https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/4169" target="_blank">https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/4169</a>.</p><p>The issue happens between Helm client versions 2.8.2 to 2.9.1. To fix this, upgrade the Helm client to the version after 2.9.1.</p><h3>Tiller and Helm in Different Namespaces</h3><p>A Helm install/upgrade can fail because Tiller is deployed in a namespace other than <code>kube-system</code>.</p><p>To fix this, pass the<code>--tiller-namespace &lt;NAMESPACE&gt;</code>as command flag in the Workflow <strong>Helm Deploy</strong> step.</p><p></p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/articles/lajo3sdfgq/1580245000966/image.png" style="max-height:50%;max-width:50%" data-hd-height="50%" data-hd-width="50%"/></figure><h3>Next Steps</h3><ul><li><strong>Pipeline and Triggers</strong> - Once you have a successful workflow, you can experiment with a Harness pipeline, which as a collection of one or more workflows, and Harness triggers, which enable you to execute a workflow or pipeline deployment using different criteria, such as when a new artifact is added to an artifact source. For more information, see <a href="/article/zc1u96u6uj-pipeline-configuration">Add a Pipeline</a> and <a href="/article/xerirloz9a-add-a-trigger-2">Add a Trigger</a>.</li><li><strong>Continuous Verification</strong> - Add verification steps using Splunk, SumoLogic, Elk, AppDynamics, New Relic, DynaTrace, and others to your workflow. For more information, see <a href="/article/myw4h9u05l-verification-providers-list">Continuous Verification</a>.</li></ul><p></p>
