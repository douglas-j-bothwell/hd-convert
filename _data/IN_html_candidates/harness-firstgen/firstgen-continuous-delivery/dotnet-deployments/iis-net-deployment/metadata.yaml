  body: '<p>This guide will walk you through deploying an IIS Website, Application,
    and Virtual Directory using Harness. For all service types, Harness automatically
    creates the Deployment Specification, which you can customize.</p><p>Walk through

    Practices and Troubleshooting</a></li></ol><h3>Deployment Overview</h3><p>Harness
    provides support for Microsoft IIS and .NET for Azure and AWS deployments. Your
    Harness applications support IIS in the following entities:</p><ul><li><strong>Services</strong>:
    There are three IIS service types:<ul><li>IIS Website.</li><li>IIS Application.</li><li>IIS
    Virtual Directory.</li><li>For all service types, Harness automatically creates
    the Deployment Specification, which you can customize.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Environments:</strong>
    You can deploy your services to Windows instances in your enterprise network or
    VPC, such as AWS and Azure.</li><li><strong>Workflows:</strong> Harness provides
    Basic, Canary, Blue/Green, Multi-Phase, and Rolling Deployment options. Default
    Rollback, Notification, and Failure Strategies are provided and can be easily
    changed.</li><li><strong>Pipelines and Triggers:</strong> Create pipelines containing
    multiple workflows and triggers to run your workflows or pipelines automatically.</li></ul><p>Harness
    provides PowerShell and WinRM support to execute workflows and communicate within
    the Microsoft ecosystem.</p><p>It is important to note that a site contains one
    or more applications, an application contains one or more virtual directories,
    and a virtual directory maps to a physical directory on a computer. To use Harness
    to deploy IIS sites, applications, and virtual directories, the IIS structural
    requirements (site &gt; application &gt; virtual directory) must be established
    on the Windows instances.</p><div class="note-callout">Before deploying the IIS
    website, application, or virtual directory to your Windows instances, there must
    be an existing <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/web-hosting/web-server-for-shared-hosting/installing-the-web-server-role"
    target="_blank">IIS Web Server Role</a> on the instance. This ensures that the
    environment is ready for deployment. Harness IIS Website deployment requires the
    IIS Web Server Role. The Harness IIS Application and IIS Virtual Directory deployments
    require that an IIS Website exists. For more information, see <a href="/article/l639i8uqxs-5-best-practices-and-troubleshooting#installing_iis_from_the_command_line">Installing
    IIS from the Command Line</a> below.</div><p>For information about IIS sites,
    applications, and virtual directories, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/get-started/planning-your-iis-architecture/understanding-sites-applications-and-virtual-directories-on-iis"
    target="_blank">Understanding Sites, Applications, and Virtual Directories on
    IIS 7</a>.</p><h4>Microsoft .NET and Azure Video Summary</h4><p>Here is a quick
    primer on deploying Microsoft IIS .NET applications and Microsoft .NET Core container
    applications using Harness Continuous Delivery.</p><div class="hd--html"><iframe

    IIS websites, applications, or virtual directories using Harness is a simple process.
    It involves setting up your deployment environment, establishing a connection
    with Harness, and then using Harness to define your deployment goals.</p><p>Here
    are the major steps in an IIS (.NET) deployment:</p><ol><li>Add connections:<ol><li><strong>WinRM
    Connection:</strong> Add a WinRM connection in Harness to execute deployment steps
    on the remote Windows servers. The connection must use a user account with permission
    to execute commands on the Windows instances.</li><li><strong>Cloud Provider:</strong>
    Add a connection to the Cloud Provider where the IIS website, application, or
    virtual directory will be deployed, such as AWS or Azure.</li><li><strong>Artifact
    Server:</strong> Add a connection to the Artifact Server where Harness can pull
    the IIS website, application, or virtual directory artifacts.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Application:</strong>
    Add a Harness Application for your IIS website, application, or virtual directory.
    An application is a logical grouping of entities, such as services, environments,
    workflows, and triggers.</li><li><strong>Service:</strong> Add a Harness Service
    in your Application for each IIS website, application, or virtual directory. This
    guide covers IIS Website, IIS Application, and IIS Virtual Directory.</li><li><strong>Environment:</strong>
    Add a Harness Environment and an Infrastructure Definition that consists of a
    WinRM Deployment type and a Cloud Provider connection that specifies the deployment
    VPC, subnets, security groups, etc. Or, if the environment is a physical data
    center, specify the IP address.</li><li><strong>Workflow:</strong> Add a Harness
    Workflow to deploy your website, application, or virtual directory. We will review
    the Workflow steps generated by Harness automatically.</li><li><strong>Deploy:</strong>
    Deploy your Workflows in the following order in a Harness Pipeline:<ol><li>IIS
    Website Workflow.</li><li>IIS Application Workflow.</li><li>IIS Virtual Directory
    Workflow.</li><li>Observe the deployment steps in real-time, and confirm in your
    VPC.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Continuous Verification:</strong> Once your deployments
    are successful, you can add verification steps into the workflow using your verification
    provider. For more information, see <a href="/article/myw4h9u05l-verification-providers-list">Continuous
    Verification</a>.</li><li><strong>Refinements:</strong> Add notification steps,
    failure strategy, and make your workflow a template for other users. For more
    information, see <a href="/article/m220i1tnia-workflow-configuration">Add a Workflow</a>.</li></ol><h3>Before
    You Begin</h3><p>This guide assumes that you are familiar with Harness architecture
    and have downloaded the Harness delegate into your enterprise network or VPC.
