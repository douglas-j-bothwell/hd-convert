  body: <p>This topic describes Harness support for Kubernetes in Harness Self-Managed
    Enterprise Edition.</p><h3>Supported Kubernetes Versions</h3><ul><li>Harness supports
    Kubernetes open source versions 1.19, 1.18, and 1.17.</li><li>Harness provides
    support for the three Kubernetes versions released before the last stable Kubernetes
    release. For example, Kubernetes v.1.19 is the most recent stable release. This
    means that Harness additionally supports Kubernetes versions 1.18, 1.17, and 1.16.</li><li>For
    Self-Managed Enterprise Edition using KOTS installation, Harness supports Kubernetes
    version 1.21.</li><li>Harness supports the other versions of Kubernetes you use
    on a best-effort basis.</li><li>Harness commits to support new minor versions
    within three months of the first stable release. For example, if the stable release
    of 1.19.0 occurs on August 15th, Harness extends compatibility by November 15th.</li></ul><h3>Terms
    of Support</h3><p>Harness does not introduce changes that break compatibility
    with supported versions. For example, Harness does not use features from Kubernetes
    version 1.18 that do not work in Kubernetes version 1.16.</p><p>Installation and
    upgrade pre-flight checks provide warnings when you use Kubernetes versions that
    are not supported.</p><p>In cases where you encounter a problem that is related
    to an incompatibility issue, you must upgrade your cluster. Harness will not issue
    a patch to accommodate the use of unsupported Kubernetes versions.</p>
