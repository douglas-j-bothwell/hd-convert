  title: Change Monitoring Quickstart
  description: ""
  short_version: ""
  body: '<div class="note-callout">Currently, this feature is in Beta.</div><p>A Harness
    Monitored Service is a Service and Environment combination that Harness monitors
    for:</p><ul><li>Any changes, such as deployments, infrastructure changes (Kubernetes
    events, auditing, etc), and alerts (PagerDuty, etc)</li><li>Any health trend deviations
    using logs and metrics obtained from APM/Logging tools</li></ul><p>This quickstart
    walks you through the steps to create a Monitored Service and add a Change Source
    to track changes.</p><h3 id="undefined">Objectives</h3><p>You&#39;ll learn how
    to:</p><ul><li>Add a Monitored Service to track your service in its environment</li><li>Add
    a Change Source to track change events</li></ul><h3>Before You Begin</h3><p>Harness
    Monitored Services and Change Sources can be set up without any Harness deployments
    having been performed, but there won&#39;t be much data for Harness to display.</p><p>If
    you already have Harness deployments in this Project, then you can use the Services
    and Environments from any of those deployments. </p><p>If there are no deployments
    in your Harness account, we recommend that you first follow the steps in a CD
    Quickstart to perform a deployment: <a href="https://ngdocs.harness.io/article/knunou9j30-kubernetes-cd-quickstart">Kubernetes
    CD Quickstart</a>, <a href="https://ngdocs.harness.io/article/cifa2yb19a-helm-cd-quickstart">Helm
    CD Quickstart</a>, or <a href="https://ngdocs.harness.io/article/uiqe6jz9o1-kustomize-quickstart">Kustomize
    Quickstart</a>.</p><h3>Step 1: Add a New Monitored Service</h3><p>In the Harness
    Project with the Service you want to monitor, navigate to the <strong>Service
    Reliability Management</strong> module.</p><p>Click <strong>Monitored Services.</strong></p><figure><img

    style="max-height:30%;max-width:30%" data-hd-height="30%" data-hd-width="30%"/></figure><p>Click
    <strong>New Monitored Service</strong>. The <strong>Add New Monitored Service</strong>
    settings appear.</p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/i5nl071jo5/articles/rvneg74vmk/1634045442446/screenshot-2021-10-12-at-7-00-22-pm.png"
    style="max-height:50%;max-width:50%" data-hd-height="50%" data-hd-width="50%"/></figure><p>This
    page displays all the settings that you need to enable to add a service, and to
    define a Change Source.</p><div class="note-callout">You can also set up a Monitored
    Service in the <a href="/article/3xhqq9xllp-verify-deployments-with-the-verify-step#step_1_add_verify_step">Verify
    step</a> in a CD stage.</div><h3>Step 2: Add a Service</h3><p>A Service represents
    your microservices, Serverless functions, and other workloads logically.</p><p>When
    you add a Service as a Monitored Service, it allows you to associate change records,
    actions, logs, metrics, and, SLO’s to the respective service.</p><p>In <strong>Overview</strong>
    under the <strong>Service</strong> tab, <strong>Application</strong> is selected
    by default in the <strong>Type</strong> field.</p><p>In <strong>Create or select
    a Service</strong>, choose the Harness Service to be monitored from the list.</p><div
    class="note-callout">As mentioned earlier, if there are no Harness deployments
    in this Project you will not have any Services. We recommend that you first follow
    the steps in a CD Quickstart to perform a deployment: <a href="https://ngdocs.harness.io/article/knunou9j30-kubernetes-cd-quickstart">Kubernetes
    CD Quickstart</a>, <a href="https://ngdocs.harness.io/article/cifa2yb19a-helm-cd-quickstart">Helm
    CD Quickstart</a>, <a href="https://ngdocs.harness.io/article/uiqe6jz9o1-kustomize-quickstart">Kustomize
    Quickstart</a>.</div><p>In <strong>Create or select an Environment</strong>, choose
    Environment where the Harness Service is deployed from the list.</p><p>Environments
    represent your deployment targets logically (QA, Prod, etc). When you add an Environment
    to a Monitored Service, it allows you to associate change records, actions, logs,
    metrics, and, SLO’s to the respective service within its associated environment.</p><p>The
    <strong>Monitored Service Name</strong> field auto-populates the concatenation
    of the Harness Service and Environment names.</p><h3>Step 3: Define Your Sources</h3><p>A
    Change Source is a combination of a Harness Service and associated Environment
    that monitors change events related deployments, infrastructure changes, and alerts.</p><p>To
    create a Change Source, click <strong>Add New Change Source</strong>. The <strong>Edit
    Change Source</strong> settings appear.</p><p>To define the Change Source, select
    <strong>Deployment</strong> in <strong>Provider Type</strong> under <strong>Select
    Change Source</strong>.</p><p>Click <strong>Harness CD NextGen</strong>.</p><figure><img

    <strong>Source Name</strong>, enter a name for the source.</p><p>Click <strong>Submit</strong>.</p><p>The
    Monitored Service gets listed as shown below.</p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/i5nl071jo5/articles/fs64l16dbp/1639630832897/nrm-ol-qiipb-4-ubw-80-e-x-d-8-a-epsg-6-nj-tutl-vk-7-untw-7-lt-wwv-a-4-fe-rjk-3-rh-3-rwta-0-woca-nb-t-2-fx-2-n-wy-s-9-wsw-aizd-fwtp-0-ia-6-t-68-z-bhgtoin-upqp-wze-cr-4-trf-8-v-sw-rw-xx-fjj-vgf-9-by"
    style="max-height:50%;max-width:50%" data-hd-height="50%" data-hd-width="50%"/></figure><p>The
    CHANGES (Last 24H) column displays all the changes related to deployments, infrastructure,
    and alerts. Click the name of the desired Monitored Service in the list, to spot
    trends or patterns that project into the future.</p><p>Now you are ready to track
    change events like:</p><ul><li>Deployments in Harness CD</li><li>Infrastructure
    changes such as <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.19/#event-v1-events-k8s-io">Kubernetes
    events</a>, and more</li><li>Alerts from PagerDuty</li></ul><p>In this tutorial,
    you learned how to:</p><ul><li>Add a Monitored Service to Harness</li><li>Add
    a Change Source which enables change events tracking</li></ul><h3>Next Steps</h3><p>See
    <a href="/article/m4pbiqb4m9-verify-deployments-in-change-intelligence-quickstart">Health
    Monitoring</a> to setup a Health Source to track Health Trends of your Service.</p>'
