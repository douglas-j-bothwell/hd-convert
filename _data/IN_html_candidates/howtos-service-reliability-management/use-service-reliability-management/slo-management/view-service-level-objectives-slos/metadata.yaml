  body: '<div class="note-callout">Currently, this feature is in Beta.</div><p>The
    <strong>SLOs</strong> (service level objectives) dashboard in the Harness Service
    Reliability Management module (SRM), helps you track, manage, and monitor all
    the SLOs set for your service. It shows an aggregated view of overall organizational
    health.</p><p>Using the <strong>SLOs</strong> dashboard you can:</p><ul><li>Visualize
    SLO trends over time and define clear targets around performance of your service</li><li>View
    a snapshot of the current state of your environment and drill down for more details</li><li>Filter
    the SLOs in a comprehensive list view</li><li>View details of individual SLOs</li><li>Keep
    track of the remaining Error Budget</li><li>Identify the Services that are at
    risk or have burned through their Error Budget </li><li>View the SLO and SLI status
    percentages</li><li>Track service level indicator (SLI) metrics in real time</li><li>Analyze
    how the actual performance of the service compares to the objectives you’ve set</li><li>Measure
    the frequency of SLO breaches over a set period</li></ul><p>This topic describes
    how you can use the <strong>SLOs</strong> dashboard to view and manage all the
    SLOs for your service at one place. </p><p>In this topic:</p><ul><li><a href="https://ngdocs.harness.io/article/29gfz9bmqc-view-service-level-objectives-slos#undefined">Before

    Objectives</h3><p>SLOs in Harness SRM, encapsulate the performance goals for your
    service and measure the reliability of your service in production. Each SLO is
    based on a performance metric called a service level indicator (SLI). SLOs enable
    you to make clear and relevant decisions about the service, its availability,
    performance, and so on. </p><p>Perform the following steps to view the SLO status
    of your service:</p><ol><li>Open a Harness Project with the Service you want to
    monitor, and navigate to the <strong>Service Reliability Management</strong> module.</li><li>Click
    <strong>SLOs</strong>. The <strong>SLOs</strong> dashboard is displayed.<div class="note-callout">Only
    the Monitored Services for which SLOs are configured will show up on the dashboard.</div><figure><img
