[UPDATE_LINK_SUCCESS] Line  14 	 Currently, this feature is behind the Feature Flags `OPA_PIPELINE_GOVERNANCE`, `CUSTOM_POLICY_STEP`, and `OPA_FF_GOVERNANCE`. Contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io) to enable the feature.Harness Policy Engine uses [Open Policy Agency (OPA)](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/) to store policies that you can then enforce on your Feature Flags. You can use Harness Policy Engine with the following [Harness entities](https://docs.harness.io/article/tygjin99y9-harness-entity-reference) on the Harness Platform:

[UPDATE_LINK_SUCCESS] Line  31 	 For steps to set up your policies on the Harness Platform, go to [Use Harness Policy Engine for Feature Flags.](https://docs.harness.io/article/vb6ilyz194-using-harness-policy-engine-for-feature-flags)#### Before you begin

[UPDATE_LINK_SUCCESS] Line  35 	 * [Harness' Key Concepts](https://docs.harness.io/article/hv2758ro4e-learn-harness-key-concepts)

[UPDATE_LINK_SUCCESS] Line  71 	 When you create the policy you can choose whether a Feature Flag receives only a warning message, or receives an error and can’t be saved when the policy isn’t met. For more information about how to do this, go to [Creating a Policy](https://docs.harness.io/article/vb6ilyz194-using-harness-policy-engine-for-feature-flags#step_1_creating_a_policy).* **Success**: You create a Feature Flag and name it `ABC-567`, which matches the naming regex you set. When you save the flag, the policy rule is evaluated, returns `Flag created`, and the flag is saved.

[UPDATE_LINK_SUCCESS] Line  82 	 To understand how to add policies for Feature Flags, go to [Use Harness Policy Engine for Feature Flags](https://docs.harness.io/article/vb6ilyz194-using-harness-policy-engine-for-feature-flags).

The Go SDK then takes care of populating this cache on startup and keeping it up to current whenever the remote service changes. When the Go SDK starts up, it retrieves all of the Features and Segments and then sends a request to the remote server to listen for any updates. Whenever there is an update in the remote service, it sends out an event, and when the embedded SDK sees one of these events, it sends a request to the remote service to get the most recent flag values and save them to the cache.
